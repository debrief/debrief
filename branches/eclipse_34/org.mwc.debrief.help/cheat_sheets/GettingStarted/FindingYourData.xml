	<intro>
		<description>Debrief NG stores it's data in a local folder called a Project.  While these are frequently created afresh, blank folders created to store new analysis data, it's also possible to denote your existing data directories as projects.  This tutorial leads you through generating links to your existing data folders.  If you've installed Debrief in the past, chances are you still have a Debrief installation folder (in C:\Program Files\Debrief 2003).  If you do still have this folder, you can usefully link it in within this tutorial to provide some sample data.  If you don't have an existing Debrief installation, there's a folder called "sample_data" in the "Workspace" folder of your Debrief NG installation.</description>

	<item title="Check Navigator is open">
		<description>In the top left hand corner of Debrief you should find the Navigator window.  If is isn't there, select "Navigator" from Debrief's Window/Show View menu.</description>
	</item>
	<item title="Check you have a workspace">
		<description>Before you can link in existing data, you need to define a project for your work.  This is a parent folder within which your links are stored.  If your Navigator window is empty, you must follow the "Generating a project" cheat-sheet accessed from the Help/Cheat Sheets menu.</description>
	</item>
	<item title="Add a new Folder">
		<description>Right-click on your current project in the Navigator view, then select 'Folder' from the 'New' sub-menu.  The New Folder wizard will open.  Instead of creating a fresh child folder to store our data, we're going to link to an existing folder.  So, whilst still in the New Folder Wizard, click the 'Advanced' button to display the Advanced options.   Next, click on the 'Link to folder in the file system', and navigate to an existing data folder on your machine or the network, clicking on "Finish" to, erm, Finish.</description>
	</item>
	<item title="Done">
		<description>Well done, there you are.  Just repeat this process to add any other data directories you want to load data from.</description>
