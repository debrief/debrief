/**
 * An EventLoop can process events on a separate worker thread.
 * It consists of two parts: the event collector and the event
 * processor.
 * <p>
 * The event collector collects all incoming events and puts them
 * into a queue.<br>
 * The event processor removes the events from the queue and 
 * processes them.
 * <p>
 * The key feature of the EventLoop is, that clients don't have
 * to wait until an event has been processed. Clients are free
 * to proceed as soon as the collector has put the event into
 * the queue.
 * <p>
 * <b>Usage</b>
 * <p>
 * This is an abstract class. It does all the queue handling, but
 * does no processing. To use it, you have to create a subclass
 * which overrides the methods #collectEvent and #processEvent.
 * <p>
 * <b>Example</b>
 * <p>
 * An EventLoop, which outputs Strings on a background thread
 * could look like this:
 * <pre><tt>
 * public class AsyncDisplay
 * extends AbstractEventLoop {
 *     public void display(String string) {
 *         collectEvent(string);
 *     }
 *     protected void processEvent(Object event) {
 *          System.out.println((String) event);
 *    }
 * }
 * </tt></pre>
 * <p>
 * To use the class proceed like this:
 * <p><pre><tt>
 * AsyncDisplay a = new AsyncDisplay();
 *  a.display("Hello World");
 * </tt></pre>
