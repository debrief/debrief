      <title>Welcome</title>

      <para>Welcome to the documentation for <application>Debrief NG</application>.
          <application>Debrief</application> was developed by the Maritime Warfare Centre in
        Portsmouth UK in the mid 90&apos;s, to support the analysis and reporting of maritime tactical exercises.</para>
        
        <tip><para>There&apos;s lots more Debrief goodness on the Debrief Home Page: <link xlink:href="http://www.debrief.info">http://www.debrief.info</link></para></tip>

      <para>In December 2000 the Maritime Warfare Centre decided to give
          <application>Debrief</application> an Open Source status, opening the application and its
        source code into the public domain. Debrief has been made <indexterm>
          <primary>Open Source</primary>
        </indexterm>Open Source to facilitate its wider use, encouraging adoption of standard file
        formats, presentation and practices between analysis agencies.</para>

        <title>Prehistory</title>

        <para><application>Debrief</application> was originally <indexterm>
            <primary>History</primary>
          </indexterm>produced in 1995 in the <glossterm linkend="g_MWC">Maritime Warfare
            Centre</glossterm> to act as a desktop viewer for results produced by the MWC&apos;s ASSET <indexterm>
            <primary>ASSET</primary>
          </indexterm> submarine simulator. In use it quickly became apparent that real exercise
          data could also be viewed in the application removing the requirement for clerical staff
          to produce paper plots for use in analysis. The initial version of
            <application>Debrief</application> was a 16-bit MS Windows C++ application.</para>

        <para><application>Debrief</application> was updated in late 1996 to 32 bits, in order to
          exploit the richer user interface components available for 32 bit Windows applications. It
          was at this stage that the application was demonstrated and subsequently issued under
          license to <indexterm>
            <primary>COMSUBDEVRON 12</primary>

            <secondary>CSDS 12</secondary>
          </indexterm>COMSUBDEVRON 12 of the US Navy.</para>

        <para>In 1999 development of an updated version of <application>Debrief</application>,
            <application>Debrief</application> 2000 was started. Over the previous four years a
          number of fresh requirements had arisen, requirements which could not be economically met
          using the existing architecture. Accordingly development of the
            <application>Debrief</application> 2000 application started from a fresh-whiteboard,
          adopting a modern modular approach to allow incremental implementation and insertion of
          future modules as they were required. The rapid maturity experienced by Java together with
          the availability of cheaply available development environments, rich application libraries
          (serialisation, Java3D and XML in particular) and its platform independence made Java the
          natural choice for the application.</para>

        <para>During 2000 <application>Debrief</application> gained wider use within the Maritime
          Warfare Centre, being used for more varied types of submarine exercise analysis together
          with analysis in surface-related warfare areas.</para>
      </sect2>

      <sect2 xml:id="SwitchToOpen">
        <title>The Switch to Open Source</title>

        <para>In Summer 2000 the Maritime Warfare Centre committed to switching the
            <application>Debrief</application> application to <indexterm significance="preferred">
            <primary>Open Source</primary>
          </indexterm>Open Source status. The adoption of the Open Source licensing model affects
          MWC in a number of ways: <orderedlist>
            <title>Debrief&apos;s Open Source benefits</title>

            <listitem>
              <para>Organisations that are currently using <application>Debrief</application> will
                have full access to the source code of <application>Debrief</application>, allowing
                them to identify and correct bugs (provided they have sufficiently trained staff).
                The licensing is such that these modifications can be again made public through the
                re-insertion into the central, online "code base".</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>Organisations that are not currently using <application>Debrief</application>
                also have full access to the application and its source code. Since the application
                and its supporting documentation clearly describe its origins in MWC this will
                spread the name of the organisation together with enforcing its reputation as a
                centre of maritime tactical analysis.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>Any organisation using <application>Debrief</application> that identifies a
                bug/algorithmic problem is able to independently correct the problem and submit the
                corrected code back into the central "code base". In time, this will greatly
                increase the accuracy and reliability of the application. MWC may then freely
                utilise these improvements, only incurring the administrative overhead of
                "checking-in" code modified by third party organisations.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>The free, open source status of the application makes it easier for third party,
                commercial organisations to bid for development contracts to maintain or extend
                  <application>Debrief</application>. This wider availability will only bring
                economic advantages to MWC and fellow organisations.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>The wider national/international use of <application>Debrief</application> will
                also lead to easier exchange of exercise data between nations (through common file
                formats) and potentially offer an increase in efficiency and the general quality of
                naval exercise analysis</para>

        <title>Debrief 2001 onwards</title>

        <para>At the end of 2000, Ian Mayo, the developer and project manager (see <xref linkend="contact_details"/>) of <application>Debrief</application>, left full-time
          employment at the Maritime Warfare Centre to setup his own software development
          consultancy, <indexterm>
            <primary>PlanetMayo</primary>
          </indexterm>PlanetMayo Ltd, now known as <indexterm>
            <primary>Deep Blue C</primary>
          </indexterm>Deep Blue C Technology Ltd.</para>

        <para>A competitive open tender process was conducted during late 2001 to supply the
          Maritime Warfare Centre with <application>Debrief</application> support. The contract was
          won by Deep Blue C, who grouped up the implementation of the MWC&apos;s fresh requirements in a
          major update to <application>Debrief</application>, titled <application>Debrief
            2001</application>. This update bought new, large areas of functionality to
            <application>Debrief</application> including vectored chart data, display of narrative
          text, and display of sensor-data.</para>

        <para>Debrief development continued in 2002, with the update to <application>Debrief
            2002</application>, which bought greatly improved 3D plotting facilities and a number of
          incremental improvements to other areas of functionality.</para>

        <para>The year 2002 also saw the first conference paper extolling the virtues of Debrief and
          the Open Source principles behind it, at <indexterm>
            <primary>UDT</primary>
          </indexterm>Undersea Defence Technology 2002 in La Spezia, Italy. The paper itself is
          available for viewing at the <link xlink:href="http://www.debrief.info" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Debrief web site</link>.</para>

        <para>Another significant step forward for Debrief in 2002 was the contribution from <indexterm>
            <primary>NUWC</primary>
          </indexterm>
          <link linkend="nuwc_address">NUWC</link> of an algorithm and code suitable for shifting
          tracks. NUWC developed a set of experimental classes used to perform track shifting (see
            <xref linkend="track_shifting"/>). The algorithms used in these classes were taken and
          modified to complement the Debrief look and feel, and to provide greater usability
          resulting in the track-shifting editor included in Debrief 2002.</para>

        <para>Through 2003-2007 Deep Blue C continued to provide MWC with contracted support for
          Debrief. This support  included user guidance, bug fixes and addition of new features.
          Additionally, this support contract was used to deliver Debrief 2003 (including the
          provision of a bathymetric bottom in 3D views, presentation of TMA data, and improved
          time-variable graphs), and the fundamental rebuild of Debrief into Debrief NG (providing a
          modular architecture ready to seamlessly accommodate ad-hoc analysis tools).</para>

        <para>In 2009 MWC extended Debrief to support Single Sided Reconstruction, that is the
          derivation of a Red track from a Blue track plus sensor data. These extensions also
          included Track Grooming changes that support the removal of jumps and general data
          smoothing.</para>

        <para>2011 saw the introduction of support for plotting chart backdrops in GeoTiff format.
          Unfortunately, this exposed performance shortcomings in the render cycle and has been
          temporarily removed pending streamlining / cacheing of the render pipeline. </para>
        <para>Charting support recommenced in Spring 2012, and a suitable implementation was found
          (See <xref linkend="ChartBackdrops"/>). Support was also introduced for using Debrief in
          the process of Exercise Planning (See <xref linkend="ExercisePlanning"/>).</para>
        <para>In 2015, under <link
            xlink:href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/defence-science-and-technology-laboratory"
            >DSTL</link> sponsorship, support for the Natural Earth dataset and sponsorship for the
          development of Semi Automatic Track Construction, was added to Debrief. Both are of
          enormous value, the former to the wide body of Debrief users (see <xref
            linkend="natural_earth"/>), and the latter to specialists interested in this small but
          select niche (see <xref linkend="satc"/>).</para>

          installation, so you will have to request and then load them separately. In 2015 Debrief

          <para>Debrief requires you to have a working folder to store your data in (a project). As
            a convenience, when you open Debrief it will check if there are any projects present. If
            none are present, you will be invited to create a project folder. Debrief will also
            offer to copy in some sample data - it's a good idea to do this.</para>
          <para>The Debrief user-interface follows the Workbench convention, whereby a users edits
            individual files in an <emphasis>Editor</emphasis> assisted by a series of supporting
            information panes called <emphasis>Views</emphasis>. The specific arrangement of editors
            and views offered by Default is called a <emphasis>
              <glossterm linkend="g_perspective">Perspective</glossterm> - </emphasis>in this
            opening instance it will be the <emphasis>Tactical Analysis</emphasis> perspective. </para>
          <para>Though views can either be dragged to any other location on the workbench or floated
            above the workbench, the Tactical Analysis perspective arranges the views into sets of
            grouped tabs. Views frequently have their own toolbar and drop-down menu which provides
            actions related to that particular task. </para>
          <para>Once selected, views are closed by clicking on the white diagonally-oriented cross.
            To re-open a view or open a fresh view select <guimenuitem>Show View</guimenuitem> from
            the <guimenu>Window</guimenu> menu; a list of Debrief-related views will then be shown.
            Other views can be selected from the <guimenuitem>Other...</guimenuitem> menu
            item.</para>

          <para>Fundamentally, the Debrief user interface (generically termed the Workbench) is
            constructed from a plot editor, surrounded by a series of support panes (called views),
            both underpinned by a main menu and a series of toolbars. These elements are described
            further below.</para>

            <para><indexterm>
                <primary>Editors</primary>
              </indexterm>Any number of editors can be open at once but, as is common with many
              applications, only one can be active at a time. The main menu bar and toolbar for
              Debrief contain operations that are applicable to the active editor. Initially the
              active editor will always be the Debrief plot, but the extensibility of Debrief NG
              means other types of editor can be implemented. Tabs at the top of the editor area
              indicate the names of files that are currently open for editing
                (<filename>Sample.dpf</filename> in the previous screenshot). An asterisk (*) in the
              tab indicates that an editor has unsaved changes. By default, editors are stacked in
              the editor area, but you can easily tile them by dragging and dropping the tabbed
              plot-name to another location in the window; this allows you to view source files
              simultaneously.</para>
          </sect3>

          <sect3 xml:id="debrief_views">
            <title>Views</title>

            <para><indexterm>
                <primary>Views</primary>
              </indexterm>Views support editors and provide alternative presentations as well as
              ways to navigate the information in your Workbench. For example, the Navigator
              displays projects and other resources that you are working with (see <xref linkend="navigating_debrief"/>), and the Outline View shows a list of selectable
              items within the current plot (see <xref linkend="layer_mgr"/>).</para>

            <para>Views also have their own drop-down menus. To open the menu for a view, click the
              icon at the right end of the view&apos;s title bar. Some views also have their own
              toolbars. The actions represented by buttons on view toolbars only affect the items
              within that view.</para>

            <para>A view might appear by itself, or stacked with other views in a tabbed notebook.
              You can change the layout of a perspective by opening and closing views as well as by
              docking them in different positions in the Workbench window. We&apos;ve attempted to
              provide a logical arrangement of Debrief views, but feel free to experiment. Debrief
              will remember your settings, but if at any point you wish to return to the presets
              select <guimenuitem>Reset Perspective</guimenuitem> from the <guimenu>Window</guimenu>
              menu.</para>
          </sect3>

          <sect3 xml:id="debrief_toolbars">
            <title>Toolbars</title>

            <para>There are four kinds of toolbars in Debrief.</para>

            <para>The <emphasis role="bold">main toolbar</emphasis>, sometimes called the Workbench
              toolbar, is displayed at the top of the Workbench window directly beneath the menu
              bar. Items in the toolbar might be enabled or disabled based on the state of either
              the active view or editor. Sections of the main toolbar can be rearranged by dragging
              and droppign with the mouse.</para>

            <para>There are also <emphasis role="bold">individual view toolbars</emphasis>, these
              appear in the title bar of a view. It's important to note that actions in a
              view&apos;s toolbar apply only to the view in which they appear. Some view toolbars
              also include a Menu button, shown as an inverted triangle, that contain actions for
              that view.</para>

            <para>Whilst Debrief doesn&apos;t currently make use of Perspectives (refer to the <xref
                linkend="perspectives_note"/> note, below), a third type of toolbar is <emphasis
                role="bold">the perspective switcher</emphasis>. The perspective switcher allows
              quick access to perspectives that are currently open. It also has a button that can
              open new perspectives. The perspective switcher is normally located in the top-right,
              next to the main toolbar. However, it is also possible to position it below the main
              toolbar ("top-left"), or to position it vertically on the left-hand side of the
              workbench ("left"). The name of the perspective is shown by default, but it is
              possible to hide the text and show only the icons. To reposition the perspective or
              hide the text, right-click on it and choose the appropriate item from the context
              menu. When Debrief contains modules for Track Reconstruction it would be
              understandable for a Track Reconstruction perspective to provide a suitably tailored
              set of views.</para>

            <para>Finally, <emphasis role="bold">the fast view bar</emphasis> is a toolbar that
              contains icons representing the current set of fast views. A fast view is a shortcut
              to a view that is frequently used; it is generated by right-clicking in a view&apos;s
              title bar. The fast view bar appears in the bottom left corner of the workbench by
              default. However, it is possible to position it on the left or right as well. In all
              cases, you can find out what toolbar buttons do by moving your mouse pointer over the
              button and reading the tooltip that opens.<note>
                <formalpara xml:id="perspectives_note">

                      <primary>Perspectives</primary>
                    </indexterm>Each Workbench window contains one or more perspectives. A
                    perspective defines the initial set and layout of views in the Workbench window.
                    Within the window, each perspective shares the same set of editors as well as
                    providing a set of functionality aimed at accomplishing a specific type of task
                    or works with specific types of resources. For example, the Tactical Analysis
                    perspective combines views that you would commonly use while analysing and
                    editing tactical exercises. Perspectives control what appears in certain menus
                    and toolbars and define visible action sets that you can change to customize a
                    perspective. Debrief allows you to save customized perspectives. These can then
                    be loaded in the same or a new window via the  <guilabel>General</guilabel> &gt;

          <title>The Debrief file format</title>

          <para>Note that the Replay file format just stores sensor readings - it does not store any
            formatting details. As a result, any formatting applied to a plot cannot be saved as a
            Replay file. Thus, Debrief has the <emphasis>Debrief File Format</emphasis>: This is a
            more complex file format that stores a wide range of data-types, formatting
            instructions, and user-interface settings (such as the current viewport on the
            data).</para>

          <para>Thus, whilst you may load data from a <emphasis>.REP</emphasis> Replay file, any
            modifications made to the plot must be stored in a Debrief Plot File
              (<emphasis>.dpf</emphasis>). No changes are save to REP files by the Debrief plot
            editor (though it possible to make textual changes to REP files using Debrief&apos;s
            built-in text editor). DPF files use the XML storage format which is capable of storing
            structured information in predefined types, as shown in the following

          <para>For most of Debrief&apos;s operations (such as adding drawing features) it needs
            to have an area to work with. When re-opening an existing plot file, or importing
            data, Debrief determines the area covered by the plot from the given data. However,
            when starting a new, blank session, Debrief doesn't know what area to use and defaults
            to its own origin at Fort Blockhouse, HMS Dolphin, Portsmouth, United Kingdom: the
            plot will be centred on 50 degrees 49 minutes North, 1 degree 19 minutes West

            </indexterm>function has been incorporated to allow users to move a track and its
            associated sensor data. The principle requirement for this functionality is to enable
            the user to move the track to a specific geographic reference point (i.e. GPS fix) or to
            lock the relative position of one track to another using sensor data. This positioning
            relative to another track is sometimes termed plot-lock <indexterm>

              <para>The Track-shifting implementation was originally provided by Mr David Gong at

            </note></para>

          <para>Debrief NG provides three modes of track shifting - moving individual track
            segments, moving individual points in a track to correct a potentially erroneous data
            point, moving whole tracks to overcome navigational system inaccuracies - such as during
            a plot-lock or tie-in. See the three modes above in <xref linkend="toggle_buttons"/>.</para>

          <para>A Stacked Dots view is used to show bearing-errors when the track-shift is being
            conducted to line up one or two sets of sensor data (see <xref linkend="sensor_data"/>).
            For each sensor bearing on a track (see <xref linkend="g_sensor_contact"/>),
              <application>Debrief</application> identifies the point on the opposing track nearest
            to that time. Each time the track is shifted (dragged)
              <application>Debrief</application> calculates the error between the sensor bearing and
            the current measured bearing, showing these in a plot (bearing error against time).<note xml:id="sensor_offset_note">
              <para>A Sensor Offset measurement (see <xref linkend="SensorOffsetsEditor"/>) is
                applied to the sensor bearing line where there sensor datum is offset from the
                attack datum of the platform</para>
            </note></para>

          <para><application>Debrief</application> displays a symbol for each visible sensor data,
            with the symbol being plotted the same colour as the sensor data. When track-shifting a
            long exercise serial, the time-variable plot may become difficult to use due to the
            y-axis always auto-scaling to accommodate all available data. Overcome this by
            instructing Debrief to filter-to-time-period (see <xref linkend="filter_to_time_period"/>) from the time controller (<xref linkend="time_controller"/>) for the plot-lock
            period, thus viewing a much smaller data-set in the time-variable plot. Additionally,
            you can zoom in on a particular area (by dragging an area downward and to the right) of
            the time-variable plot for detailed analysis, dragging the mouse up and to the left to
            clear the zoom.</para>

          <para>Note the four modes of drag supported by the bearing error view. For the
            non-translate operations you are still able to perform a translate by picking up the
            track segment at its mid-way mark.</para>

            pre-process track data to remove jumps and generally smooth the data. The 2009 Single

            inertial navigation systems is to load the data in DR mode (see <xref linkend="import_modes"/>). The alternative is to move the track before/after the jump
            to line up the two sections.<screenshot>

          In addition to combining periods of track (legs), Debrief is able to generate sections of
            track to join existing sections. It performs this using a series of Cubic Spline
            calculations. The Splines cover Lat, Long, Depth, Course and Speed. In this way, the
            infill segment introduces track points that provide a smooth transition in the above
            attributes from one track to the other. The time interval used for the data points in
            the infill section is taken from the time interval between the first two points of the
            second segment. On the plot, the infill segment is shown as a dotted line, to indicate
            that its series of purely calculated positions, and not based on any observed
            measurements.
            <tip><para>These infill sections are actually dynamic.  So, as you move/drag your

          <para>Debrief is able to automatically remove jumps, transforming less accurate track
            periods so that they tidily match high-confidence (but infrequent) GPS fixes. A jump is
            determined as two consecutive updates where the speed in the second update is 3 or more
            times larger than that in the previous update. The following fictional diagram shows a
            period of drift, with two green markers indicating the start/end of the dived period. A
            GPS fix was obtained at the green marker near the North-West. Then the submarine dived,
            and the drift error grew cumulatively. The next GPS fix was obtained at the time of the
            green marker near the South East. <screenshot>

            <guibutton>Remove jumps for selected track</guibutton>.  But, please note that this will
            probably give a sub-optimal solution.  When the whole track is selected, Debrief uses the first
            point in that track as the first lock point.  For a more accurate tidied track, manually select
            the positions, ensuring a real GPS fix is used as the first point.

              the data values recorded on or immediately after the indicated stepper time (see the
                <xref linkend="time_calc"/> for more detail).</para>

          <para>One <glossterm linkend="g_track">track</glossterm><indexterm>
              <primary>Primary track</primary>
            </indexterm> currently loaded is assigned as the Primary track (the red track in this
            instance), and then one or more tracks are assigned as <indexterm>
              <primary>Secondary track</primary>
            </indexterm>Secondary tracks. The primary track always shows absolute data such as
            current course, speed and depth. With just a single secondary track specified, it also
            shows relative (calculated) data - as illustrated above. The secondary tracks always
            display both absolute data (course, speed, depth), plus the relative data respective to
            the primary. Thus, remember that if you want to see the primary track&apos;s relative bearing
            to the secondary, make sure there&apos;s just the one secondary track selected.</para>

          <para>Not only tracks can be placed on the Tote. Most annotations (labels, circles, etc)
            can also be set as primary or secondary track. If no time is available for an annotation
            it is deemed to always be valid, and calculations are shown although the time field is
            displayed as "n/a". However, if the annotation has start and end times the tote displays
            "n/a" when outside that period and calculated data when inside it.</para>

          <note>
            <para>It may be useful to remember that the Primary Track is usually assigned to the
              Target, thereby allowing a constant display of target bearing and range.</para>

              <para>It is not just tracks that can be added to the Tote, experiment with
                right-clicking on features on the plot and see if they have the "Set Primary Track"
                or "Set Secondary Track" commands available (although read the note below about
                these). In this way you can make a timed data point (represented by a Circle with a
                very small radius) the primary track, then add a number of vessel tracks as
                secondary tracks, and then as you move through the data you can constantly see the
                vessel range and bearings from this data point. This is particularly useful for
                seeing vessel ranges and bearings from a <glossterm linkend="g_sensor">sensor</glossterm> such as a sonar buoy. Remember to set the DTG data for the
                data point to time(s) near those of the track - or else in your example
                  <application>Debrief</application> will assume the "sonar buoy" is not yet

          <title>Plotting modes</title>

          <para>The plotting mode affects the origin and orientation of the plot. In
              <emphasis>Normal</emphasis> mode the plot viewport stays static as the time changes,
            but if <emphasis>Primary Centred/North oriented</emphasis> mode is selected, the
            viewport moves to track the primary participant. Beyond that, the <emphasis>Primary
              Centred/North oriented</emphasis> mode orients the plot to match the heading of the
            primary track. This mode is particularly useful for presenting a scenario from the
            perspective of the primary participant, but the quickly changing orientation can be
            off-putting.</para>

          <tip>
            <para>Primary Centered/North Oriented mode is particularly useful for analysing one
              vessel trailing another. If you make the trailing vessel the primary track and the
              vessel being trailed the secondary track, as you step forward through the serial you
              will clearly be able to see the relative bearing of the contact as held by the
              trailing vessel.</para>

            <para>The sample shown below gives a demonstration of the use of this mode. You can
              quickly see that the blue vessel is directly ahead of the red trailing vessel, and
              your use of the Range Ring Highlighter gives us a quick indication of range. <figure xml:id="relative_display_demo">

            configured such that the slider stops on higher resolutions by selecting the relevant

            Looking at the order of buttons in the Time Controller screenshot above, the commands
            allow you to move to the beginning, move a large step backwards, move a small step
            backwards and repeat the last time step continuously (small or large step, backwards or
            forwards). The remaining buttons repeat these operations in the "forward" direction. The
            size of small and large steps is controlled by the Time Controller properties window,
            accessed by selecting <guimenu>Properties</guimenu>/<guimenuitem>Time
              Controller</guimenuitem>. Also available from this set of properties is the

          <para>Whilst Debrief users have enjoyed VPF and ETOPO reference datasets for vector and
            raster backdrops (resp) for over 10 years,these have now been superceded by the Open
            Source <glossterm linkend="g_ne">Natural Earth</glossterm> dataset.  Natural Earth vectored data doesn&apos;t come with any
            styling, so the team employed a very clever professional cartographer 
            (Julie at <link xlink:href="http://jewelcartografx.com/">http://jewelcartografx.com/</link>) to produce a set
            of themes to apply to the various Natural Earth feature types.</para>
          <para>
            The Natural Earth download size has also be reduced by focussing on a specific set of 
            features of interest to the maritime domain.  Lastly, the data-points in this 
            set of data-files have been
            subtlely trimmed to remove points at the poles, to make them suitable for Debrief&apos;s 
            mercator projection.  The data-point trimming was performed with the most excellent
            QGis application (<link xlink:href="http://qgis.org">http://qgis.org</link>).
          </para>
          <para>
            The detailed Natural Earth data is around 80Mb in size, so it&apos;s too large to
            include with Debrief.  So, only they very highest scale, lowest resolution data is 
            included with Debrief.  This gives a world coastline and named countries. If
            you require more detailed data (which you almost certainly will), just download the more
            detailed dataset and unpack it on your disk - as detailed below.

            Chart (ONC) series co-produced by the military mapping authorities of Australia, Canada,
            United Kingdom, and the United States. The complete database is available on a set of
            four CD-ROMs and contains more than 1,800 megabytes of vector data organized into 10
            thematic layers. VMap Level 0 includes major road and rail networks, hydrologic drainage
            systems, utility networks (cross-country pipelines and communication lines), major
            airports, elevation contours, coastlines, international boundaries and populated places.
            VMap Level 0 includes an index of geographic names to aid in locating areas of interest.
            VMap Level 0 is accessible directly from the CD-ROM or can be transferred to a hard
            drive and used in many geographic information system (GIS) applications.</para>

              </listitem>

              <listitem>
                <para>It allows you to view the contents of multiple CD-Roms simultaneously (the
                  VMap level 0 data comes on 4 CDs so unless you have 4 CD-readers in your machine

            </itemizedlist></para>

          <para>So, on the assumption that you do want to copy the data to your hard disk, here is a

              <listitem>
                <para>Create a folder in the top level of your hard disk called

              <listitem>
                <para>Now insert the first VPF CD-Rom and view it through your file manager (e.g.
                    <application>Windows Explorer</application>). You need to find which directory
                  contains the actual data, so have a look in each of the top level directories for
                  a directory which contains the files <filename>DHT</filename> and
                    <filename>LAT</filename>. Note, for VMap data this is a directory named
                    <filename>VMAPLV0</filename>. When you&apos;ve found this directory copy it across to
                  the <filename>VPF</filename> directory you created on your hard disk.</para>
              </listitem>

              <listitem>
                <para>So for VMap data, your hard disk you should have a directory named
                    <filename>VPF</filename>, containing your first set of VMap data in a directory
                  named <filename>VMAPLV0</filename>.</para>
              </listitem>

              <listitem>
                <para>You will be copying in a number of data sets with this directory name, so
                  rename <filename>VMAPLV0</filename> to the name of the current dataset (such as

              </listitem>

              <listitem>
                <para>Next, swap your CD for the next CD in the series, copy the directory of

          <para>How does it <application>Debrief</application> handle VPF data? <itemizedlist>
              <listitem>
                <para>When you save a plot with VPF data loaded, <application>Debrief</application>
                  stores the names of all of the layers loaded, together with the colours and

              </listitem>

              <listitem>
                <para>When you re-load an existing session with VPF data,
                    <application>Debrief</application> reads what layers the users wants and only
                  loads those layers.</para>
              </listitem>
            </itemizedlist></para>

          <para>Accordingly, you could create a datafile containing only the layers you want, and
            drop this file into <application>Debrief</application> sessions. This should give us a
            simplified set of VPF layers.</para>

          <para>When you drag/drop a <glossterm linkend="g_xml">DPF</glossterm> file into an
            existing session, the Layers in the <glossterm linkend="g_xml">DPF</glossterm> file are
            copied into the existing session, although the projection, Tote, and GUI parameters are

        <sect2 xml:id="vpf_how_to">
          <title>How to do it - 1</title>

          <para>So what you do is open a new <application>Debrief</application> session and load the

          <para>Then add your VPF layers using the <guibutton>Create VPF Layers</guibutton> button
            on the <guilabel>Chart Features</guilabel> toolbar. Customise these layers so that the
            layers/features of interest are made visible and set to your desired colours.</para>

          <para>Finally save the view to a plot file in an easily accessible location - call it

          <para>As you can see above, the file starts with an entry beginning with the characters
              <guilabel>&lt;?xml</guilabel>. This line indicates that you are handling <glossterm linkend="g_xml">XML</glossterm> data.</para>

          <para>Next you have a series of lines of data, which start with
              <guilabel>&lt;plot&gt;</guilabel> and end with <guilabel>&lt;/plot&gt;</guilabel>.
            This format is similar to that found in HTML, and indicates that this file contains
            details of plot. Inside the <guilabel>&lt;plot&gt;</guilabel> you can see a
              <guilabel>&lt;session&gt;</guilabel>, which in turn contains a
              <guilabel>&lt;layers&gt;</guilabel> object, containing a series of
              <guilabel>&lt;layer&gt;</guilabel> items, followed by a
              <guilabel>&lt;projection&gt;</guilabel>, and a
            <guilabel>&lt;gui&gt;</guilabel>.</para>

          <para>What you are going to do is strip out everything except the Layers object, and then
            thin this out.</para>

          <para>So, move the cursor to the <guilabel>&lt;layers&gt;</guilabel> line. Delete
            everything before this (except for the <guilabel>&lt;?xml version="1.0"

            everything from it to the end of the file.</para>

          <para>As you look at the layers, you can see that each layer has a name ( <guilabel>Chart
              Features</guilabel> is the first one in the example above). It is the <guilabel>Chart
              Features</guilabel> layer which you want to keep, so navigate down to the next Layer
            (which may have a track name), and delete that and all others (down to, but not
            including the <guilabel>&lt;/layers&gt;</guilabel> line which marks the end of the
            data).</para>

          <para>Within the <guilabel>Chart Features</guilabel> layer you can see an entry named
              <guilabel>&lt;vpf_database&gt;</guilabel> - this is the vpf data. Inside the

            loaded (probably just VMaplv0 in your instance).</para>

          <para>Inside the <guilabel>&lt;vpf_library&gt;</guilabel> are a series of
              <guilabel>&lt;vpf_coverage&gt;</guilabel> entries. It is these which you will thin
            out. Work down through them deleting any you don&apos;t want. In your instance you only want
            to keep the boundaries data, so you will delete all other coverages. So, select blocks
            of text beginning with <guilabel>&lt;vpf_coverage&gt;</guilabel> and ending with

          <note xml:id="etopo_description">
            <para>The &apos;ETOPO-5&apos; data set is originally from the U.S. National Geophysical Data
              Center (NGDC) in Boulder, Colorado (USA), and represents the "best" available digital
              terrain values as integrated from existing five and ten-minute digital sources. The
              data set has elevation values spaced at every five-minute latitude/longitude crossing
              on the global grid (approx. nine km.-sq. spatial resolution, or 12 x 12
              pixels/degree), and a one-meter contour interval. Bathymetric values are included in
              this data set, starting at approximately 10,000 meters below sea level, while the
              elevation values extend up to heights of approximately 8,000 meters above sea level.
              Some original sources of the data used include the U. S. Defense Mapping Agency for
              the conterminous USA, Japan and Western Europe; the Australian Bureau of Mineral
              Resources, and the New Zealand Department of Scientific and Industrial
              Research.</para>

            <para>GRID has reformatted the original NGDC data file to place the origin at 180
              degrees West longitude, instead of at 0 degrees Greenwich Meridian. The &apos;ETOPO-5&apos; data
              file has 2160 records of data with a length of 8640 bytes each: the size of the data
              array is 2160 lines by 4320 elements, but this is a l6-bit or two bytes per element
              data file. The origin of the data file is at 90 degrees North latitude and 180 West
              longitude, and it extends to 90 degrees South latitude and 180 degrees East longitude.
              The data file comprises 18.66 Megabytes. The version of this data file at GRID has
              been discovered to contain two records (lines) of flawed data values; that is,
              portions of lines 2055 and 2056, beginning at the Weddell Sea north of Antarctica and
              continuing eastward. GRID is currently waiting for a response from the data supplier
              (NGDC) before attempting any replacement of what appear to be anomalous data
              values.</para>

                    exploited by giving a unique sensor name to each track being recorded on a
                    sensor - allowing tracks to be independently switched on and off.</para>

                <listitem>
                  <para>This is an individual contact recorded on a sensor, a single bearing line
                    reaching from the sensor location (origin) along the contact bearing to the
                    contact range.</para>
                </listitem>
              </varlistentry>
            </variablelist></para>

          <para>The sticky issue of whether to represent sensor data in absolute coordinates (where
            each line has its own origin) or whether to represent the data in relative coordinates
            (where the sensor origin is assumed to be the current ownship position) is managed
            through the ability to enter NULL fields for the sensor location.</para>

          <para>Support for relative coordinates is provided for two reasons: <itemizedlist>
              <listitem>
                <para>Some <glossterm linkend="g_sensor">sensor</glossterm> data sources may
                  genuinely not contain positional data - allowing relative coordinates will ease
                  the workload in these instances.</para>
              </listitem>

              <listitem>
                <para>In the submarine plot-lock process it is quite common to experiment with a
                  number of track-shifts until the hull-mounted sensor bearing fans tie up with the
                  other vessel. By keeping the sensor data separate to the vessel data, the existing
                  sensor data-file can be dropped into Debrief with the updated vessel track-file,
                  allowing the user to perform a visual qualitative check on the shift
                  applied.</para>
              </listitem>
            </itemizedlist></para>

          <para>Note, it is not possible to define the sensor offset value in the REP file (see
              <xref linkend="SensorOffsetsEditor"/>), it may only be defined from the Properties
            Window of Debrief NG. The value is stored safely when the Debrief plot is saved,
            however.</para>

          <para>When Sensor Contact data is being plotted for a Sensor using relative coordinates,
            Debrief reflects a Sensor Offset distance for that sensor. The sensor offset distance
            denotes the horizontal distance between the centre of the centre and the attack datum of
            the host platform (+ve forwards, -ve backwards - so towed array data would be -ve). See
            the next section for more detail on the support for a shared library of array lengths.
            The location of the start of the sensor contact bearing line is calculated using the
            current value of course for the host platform and the sensor offset value.<note>
              <para>Sensor data is typically added to a plot by dragging/dropping it from the
                  <guimenu>Navigator</guimenu> view. If the dragged in datafile only contains cuts
                from a single sensor a dialog pops up give you chance to override the sensor name
                and color. If the file contains data from more than one sensor then they just
                quietly slip in.</para>

            </indexterm>When examining a Sensor in the properties view, you will see that in
            addition to Sensor Offset, there is a &apos;Worm in the hole&apos; (see <xref linkend="WormInHole"/>). This is typically used for towed arrays, whereby the start of the sensor bearing
            line is located at the Sensor Offset distance back along the host platform track,
            instead of in a straight line behind the host.</para>

          </indexterm>Since Autumn 09 Debrief has supported a library of sensor offsets. These
            offsets are used to populate a drop-down list of lengths, used in support of specifying
            sensor offsets.</para>

          <para>Somewhere on your network create a csv-formatted text file that stores two columns
            of data (as shown below). The first column is the platform/sensor name, the second
            column is that combination&apos;s array offset in metres (with -ve figures at the stern of
            the host platform). The file should end in a csv suffix, and is formatted as
            follows:<screen>Sensor Name,Length (m)
Platform A,-45
Platform B,-124.6
Platform C,-551</screen></para>

          <para>Then open the Debrief preferences page, and specify the offset file location using
            the <guilabel>Standard Array Offsets</guilabel> page<screenshot>

            <para>Note, if you haven&apos;t got a sensor array offsets file assigned, you can still enter
              a value by hand. But, you do not need to specify the metres units. For an array offset
              of -400m, just enter -400.</para>

          <para>Sensor data is loaded into Debrief in REP files, just like any other Debrief data.
            The line format is one of:

              which is your &apos;ownship&apos; track, and which are the tracks of interest. Do this by
              marking tracks as primary and secondary in the Track Tote (see <xref linkend="assigning_tracks"/>). Once you have a primary track set, select
                <guilabel>Bulk Sensor Manager</guilabel> from the <guilabel>Window/Show
                View</guilabel> menu. You&apos;ll see a plot like the one below:<screenshot>

              tracks are displayed in bold lines (the thick green line in the screenshot) - so,
              you&apos;ll typically be trying to determine which blocks of sensor data are close
              to/similar to target tracks. Sensor data is shown with symbols if it&apos;s visible in the
              plot (see the pink line near the centre-left of the image). Clicking on a block of
              sensor data in the view also selects that sensor data in the Outline View (though on
              occasion you need to expand the <guilabel>Sensors</guilabel> folder in the Layer
              Manager). As blocks of sensor data are selected, they are shown in black in the view.
              Items can be multiple-selected with the <keysym>&lt;ctrl&gt;</keysym> key. Once

              then there&apos;ll be a jump over to were that track number is used again against another
              contact on the right hand side.</para>

            <para>Debrief offers a tool to automatically split sensor data - the scissors icon at

              jump of more than 15 seconds Debrief splits the successive data into a new tracks. The

              of 10s of nautical miles long. If in truth the detections are only in the thousands of
              yards, you may wish to give the sensor data a range. To do this, start by
              multi-selecting a block of sensor data in the Outline View. Next, open the properties
              window - you&apos;ll see the elements have zero range. Just insert an &apos;indicative&apos; value
              for range. The sensor lines on the plot will now be clipped to that range - greatly
              reducing plot clutter.<screenshot>

            occasion you may wish to view a time graph of the range from the array centre to the

            target. Open the graph by multi-selecting (&lt;ctrl-click&gt;) a series of sensor
            wrappers and a single target track (alternately you could select one track plus the
            &apos;Sensors&apos; item of another track if you wish to view a range plot that includes all the
            sensors). If such a combination of objects have been selected in the Outline View, when

          <para>The concept of Bearings Only Target Motion Analysis, or Bearings Only Tracking (BOT)

            the 688i game. This system utilises a variant on that concept. Whilst BOT focuses on the
            production of a near-real time estimate of the current state (location, course, speed)
            of the subject vehicle, this system performs the process time-late, aiming to produce a
            whole segment of vehicle track. The time-late nature of the undertaking (possibly
            several weeks later) means that an analyst has the opportunity to research other
            information about the vehicle track to contribute to the algorithm. This other
            information may be through acoustic analysis, supplementary documentation, or

                <term>5. Import as Debrief Track</term>
                <listitem>
                  <para>Ultimately, if/when the analyst is happy with the solution produced he can
                    import the solution into Debrief, either as a collection of legs (to be used in
                    the existing manual TMA process), or directly as a conventional Debrief
                    track.</para>

              </varlistentry>
            </variablelist></para>
          <para>Internally, the SATC process runs in two stages.  The first considers
            hard-constraints that the analyst has recorded for the engagement.  These constraints
            are intelligently fused into a consolidated body of constraints, one set for each
            potential target location (one location is produced for each bearing measurement).  This
            phase is able to run very quickly, since it just deals with hard facts.  It is possible
            to view the set of constraints changing live on the Debrief plot whilst the
            hard-constraints are manipulated.</para>
          <para>The second stage is where candidate solutions are produced. This stage can be quite
            time-consuming, so it is only run on analyst request. The stage produces an imaginary
            grid over the potential start and end positions for each straight leg. The algortihm
            then looks at the possible straight courses between combinations of these points. An
            optimisation algorithm reduces the number of permutations that need to be considered.
            The optimisation algorithm also discards solutions that, whilst mathematically optimal,
            do not represent achievable successive courses (due to simple speed/time calculations). <screenshot>

            you must first register at <link xlink:href="https://github.com">www.GitHub.com</link>. Once registered,
            you can navigate to the <link xlink:href="https://github.com/debrief/debrief/issues">Debrief Issues</link> page, click on the &apos;New Issue&apos; button, and submit a request for a bug-fix or new
            features. The items are then tracked, and provided an e-mail address was provided, the
            submitter is kept informed of the progress of the submission.</para>

          <para>The following screenshot shows the form used to submit bugs. Don&apos;t worry if you&apos;re
            not quite sure if the bug is actually intended behaviour, or if you&apos;re unsure whether a
            proposed new feature would &apos;make the cut&apos;. Once your request is emailed it&apos;s recorded on
            the system and an informed debate/discussion can follow. This ensures requests don&apos;t
            fall through the cracks.</para>

          <para>Debrief installs itself into a <filename>Debrief NG</filename> folder in the top

            files used for optimised graphics (<filename>gdiplus.dll</filename>), and copy to

          <para>The <filename>jre</filename> folder contains a Java Runtime Environment that&apos;s been
            modified by the inclusion of a current set of Java3d libraries. In the absence of this
              <filename>jre</filename> folder Debrief (Eclipse) would use the system&apos;s default Java
            installation, if there was one. Including it overrides any other configured
            library.</para>

          <para>The <filename>configuration</filename> folder contains details of Debrief&apos;s initial
            settings together with the locations of update download sites.</para>

          <para>The <filename>features</filename> and <filename>plugins</filename> folders include
            details of what Eclipse plugins are present (where each feature is actually a group of
            plugins), together with the plugins themselves. The <filename>workspace</filename>
            folder is a default workspace provided for new users. It contains current work projects
            together with a large volume of metadata representing change history, screen layout and
            user preferences.</para>

        <sect2 xml:id="mulit_user">
          <title>Multi-user Debrief installation</title>

          <para>The conventional way of installing Debrief is for each user to have their own copy,
            maintaining their own sets of plugins and updates (as above). There is an alternate
            installation scenario, however - for all users to share a common Debrief installation.
            An advantage of this scenario is that software updates only need to be performed once,
            at the central location. By default, however, shared installations are troublesome for
            Debrief - since all users will be looking at a single set of settings - so administrator
            participation is necessary.</para>

          <para>Whilst a number of theoretical solutions exist for this problem, the most reliable
            solution to emerge is to force Debrief NG to use the workspace in the users own login
            directory (since each user has a unique login directory). This also overcomes the
            challenge of new users having to select a workspace before they know what a workspace
            is.</para>

          <para>Thus, the Debrief shortcut (.ini file) has been modified to explicitly indicate that
            the workspace is in the a folder in the user login
            area:<screen>-data
@user.home/.DebriefNG</screen>The &apos;.&apos; character before the DebriefNG
            folder name follows a convention that is normally sufficient to make the operating
            system make the folder hidden by default.<tip>
              <para>When users are upgrading from older versions of DebriefNG, the application will
                ignore the last workspace location, and load a new, blank workspace from the new
                user directory. If the user now closes Debrief the workspace data can be copied from
                the old location into the new location, which will get read when the application
                re-opens.</para>

        <sect2 xml:id="CentralUpdates">
          <title>Centralised software updates</title>

          <para>In the Autumn 2009 updates Debrief adopted the Eclipse p2
              <emphasis>update</emphasis> mechanism. With this update came support for centralised
            updates. Centralised updates allow updated Debrief components to be placed at a central
            location on shared network storage, with individual Debrief installations automatically
            updating from it.</para>

          <para>Start by locating a central shared folder, and creating a
              <emphasis>Repository</emphasis> folder in it. This is where your Debrief maintainer
            will unzip Debrief updates. Next, you must tell the individual Debrief installations
            where the repository is. Do this from the <guilabel>Preferences</guilabel>
            <guilabel>Install/Update</guilabel>
            <guilabel>Available Software Sites</guilabel> dialog:<figure xml:id="ReposLocation">

            French(Canada). The application cannot read data-files correctly, nor can it populate
            screen editors. The workaround to this problem is to explicitly direct Debrief to
            startup using an English locale. Do this by launching Debrief with the "-nl en" command
            parameter. This can be performed either by modifying the shortcut used to start Debrief,
            or by adding the command parameter to the <filename>Debrief.ini</filename> configuration
            file (though this will have to be re-performed after each Debrief update).</para>

              <para>In 2015 the Debrief symbology attributes were extended to allow richer
                formatting to be applied to data on import. The new attributes mean it is possible
                to use a 2 or 5 character symbology element for each REP line. This was of
                particular value in supporting quick turnaround, in-stride, fast-look analysis. It
                is also of value when high volumes of annotations are produced using a simulation
                environment such as <link xlink:href="https://www.atlas-elektronik.com/what-we-do/submarine-systems/odin/">Odin</link>.</para>

          <para>In addition to the positional vessel track data, annotations can also be added. Each
            annotation is placed on a single line in a replay file, each line beginning with the
            comment marker; a semi-colon &apos;;&apos;.To put a comment on a line, begin with two
            semi-colons.</para>

              <para>Note, when null positions are entered for <glossterm linkend="g_sensor">Sensor</glossterm> data, the position is taken from the track named in "ownship
                name". Debrief finds the nearest track location equal to or greater than the
                indicated time, and uses this as the sensor lat and long.</para>

              <para>As with normal positional data, annotation entries which use a track/ownship
                name may contain multi-word phrases if they are enclosed in quotation marks ("),
                and the year can be expressed as 2 or 4 figures.</para>

              <para>Debrief can handle decimal values for degrees or minutes. If you original data
                is in decimal degrees or degrees plus decimal minutes feel free to use these values
                directly, but remember to provide a zero for the unused column(s).  Examples of this

            <para>In addition to individual annotation shapes it is possible to define a dynamic annotation.  Do
              this by using a series of dynamic annotations, all with the same annotation name.  Once

              to the Time Controller).  The dynamic annotations largely take the same format as their non-dynamic

              It is also possible to attach annotations to tracks - so that the annotation moves (and rotates) with
              the track. These annotations can be grouped. This allows the dynamic shape itself to change 
              dimensions during its life, but with the whole collection of shapes switched on and off as one.</para>

              <para>Keyhole Markup Language (KML) is an XML-based language schema for expressing
                geographic annotation and visualization on existing or future Internet-based,
                two-dimensional maps and three-dimensional Earth browsers. KML was developed for use
                with Google Earth, which was originally named Keyhole Earth Viewer. It was created
                by Keyhole, Inc, which was acquired by Google in 2004. The name "Keyhole" is an
                homage to the KH reconnaissance satellites, the original eye-in-the-sky military
                reconnaissance system first launched in 1976. KML is an international standard of
                the Open Geospatial Consortium. Google Earth was the first program able to view and
                graphically edit KML files, and other projects such as Marble have also started to
                develop KML support</para>

        <para>The display of chart data in Debrief is all down to the <link xlink:href="http://geotools.org/"><citetitle>GeoTools</citetitle></link> library.
          Recently the SWT module was added to this library. The SWT module incorporates the
          SwtMapPane class upon which the Debrief plot now sits. With the incorporation of GeoTools
          brings a wide range of new file formats, both image and vector, plus more advanced
          topographic and earth model related capabilities. Rest assured, Debrief will exploit these
          library features as much as possible in coming months/years.</para>

        <para><emphasis>LEGACY ALGORITHM</emphasis> In the past, Debrief used the Rhumb-line
          calculation for the display of measured range-bearing and for the projection of data onto
          the monitor. Briefly, to convert from real-world to screen coordinates the following
          procedure was followed:</para>

              <para>Determine the centre of this data area - this is used as the origin of the

            <listitem>
              <para>For each data point to be plotted, find its range and bearing from the
                origin</para>

            <listitem>
              <para>Convert this range and bearing into a delta-x and delta-y in screen
                coordinates</para>

              <para>Produce a data point in screen coordinates by adding these deltas to the centre
                of the screen</para>

          </orderedlist></para>

        <note>
          <para>The result of this projection algorithm (as with most others) is that whilst the
            information plotted at the centre horizontal section (mid-latitude) of the screen is an
            accurate representation, travelling further north and south from it degrades the
            accuracy. This is negligible in data areas near the equator or where only a small area
            is covered (less than a couple of hundred nautical miles). With greater data areas, and
            nearer the poles, the effects are more noticeable, however.</para>

        <para>For those without access to the Admiralty Manual of Navigation, here is an abbreviated
          snippet from it:</para>

          <title>LEGACY - The Rhumb-Line formulae</title>

          <para>A line on the earth&apos;s surface which cuts all meridians at the same angle is called a
            rhumb line.</para>

          <para>With his knowledge of the distance along a parallel of latitude and the departure
            between two places, the navigator can find the course he must steer in order to follow
            the rhumb line joining the two places, and also the distance he will travel along whilst
            doing so. In <xref linkend="rhumb_line_parts"/> FT is the rhumb-line divided into a
            large number of equal parts FA, AB, BC... <figure xml:id="rhumb_line_parts">

          <para>Af, Ba, Cb... are the arcs of parallels drawn through A, B, C ... and the angles at
            f, a, b ..., are therefore at right-angles. If the divisions of FT are made sufficiently
            small, the triangles FaF, ABa, BbB ... are themselves small enough to be treated as
            plane triangles. Also, since the course angle at F, A, B, C, ... remains constant by the
            definition of a rhumb-line, these small triangles are equal.</para>

          <para>By the term <emphasis>short-distance sailing</emphasis> is meant the following of a
            rhumb-line track for a distance not greater than 600&apos;. Within this limiting distance,
            the navigator can obtain all he wants to know about the track from the three
            formulae:</para>

departure = distance sin (course)     (2)

              <secondary>Worm in the hole</secondary>
            </indexterm>Frequently vehicles in Debrief use sensors with a different datum to the
            host platform - either because they&apos;re several metres from the position recorded datum
            on board the platform, or because they&apos;re an offboard sensor dragged behind the sensor.
            For an onboard sensor it is acceptable to locate the sensor by reference to its sensor
            length offset in conjunction with the current heading. However for an offboard sensor
            this coarse calculation may not be representative of the actual sensor location. When a
            platform is on a straight-line course, it is acceptable to plot the sensor datum back
            along the reverse heading. But, when a platform has travelled through a turn, plotting
            the sensor datum at the reciprocal of the platform heading will place the sensor in an
            unrealistic location. To counter this, Debrief offers a &apos;Worm in the hole&apos; sensor
            locating model.</para>

          <para>The &apos;worm in the hole&apos; algorithm takes the sensor length offset value, and
            determines the point this specified distance back along the platform track. The metaphor
            is that a worm has opened a tunnel through a body of material. The sensor is being
            dragged through this tunnel, and we determine the sensor location accordingly.</para>

          <note>
            <para>This is not a perfect algorithm. In truth, during a turn the forces on a towed
              array will cause it to slip sideways, cutting off the corner to an extent. It is the
              responsibility of the analyst to appraise himself with array performance and determine
              the applicability of the worm in the hole algorithm - though note its results are much
              more accurate than the non-worm in the hole straight line model.</para>
          </note>
        </sect2>

        <sect2 xml:id="WormExample">
          <title>Example</title>

          <para>The screenshot belows shows a comparison of the two models. The red ownship track
            has positions at times 100,200,300 and 400. The sensor track has positions at times
            100,140,280,350. The array is 400m long.</para>

          <para>The two array models show the same value for the first 3 points plotted: in the
            first two of these the array falls behind the start of the ownship track - thus the
            reciprocal of ownship heading is necessary to determine the position. In the third
            position, the length of the 400m array falls completely within the 600m leg.</para>

          <para>The fourth position is, however, different. The straight-line model plots it back
            along the reciprocal of the platform heading at time 300. The worm in the hole model,
            however, turns back along the ownship track from position 200 to 300. At time 350, the
            ownship platform will be 1/2 way down between positions 300 and 400 - this will consume
            1/2 of the 600m separation (300m), leaving another 100m of array to be consumed - this
            the algorithm moves 100m back down between the points at 200 &amp; 300.<screenshot>

            </indexterm>In the Single Sided Reconstruction extensions to Debrief (2009) the use of
            frequency data in track reconstruction, specifically involving the application of
            Doppler Offsets. The algorithms used have been loosely taken from the Royal Naval
            Submarine School training guide titled <emphasis>The Bearing Frequency Plot and
              Narrowband Analysis</emphasis>. The core doppler calculation is as
            follows:<programlisting>	private static double calcDopplerComponent(final double theBearingRads,

				* mySpeedKts);

		// put rel brg into +/- 180 domain
		while (relBearingRads &gt; Math.PI)
			relBearingRads -= (2 * Math.PI);

			dopplerOffset = -dopplerOffset;
		return dopplerOffset;
	}</programlisting>The
            doppler calculation is used in calculation of the corrected frequency - which involves
            the removal of the ownship doppler
            component:<programlisting>	public double getCorrectedFrequency()

          The initial strategy to remove drift was to find the range/direction of the jump from the last dived 
          point to the first GPS fix.  But, during implementation it became clear that this
          wouldn&apos;t work.  What was actually needed was to "plot-on" the last dived point to 
          derive where the dived track would be at the time of the GPS fix.  
          The following diagram shows a stylized representation of a period of dived drift.

          </screenshot>
          In the diagram, the measured track is AEF, but the true track was AF. 
          We can see that the correct location for B is B&apos;, C is C&apos;, and so on.  
          So, the vector necessary to transform B to B&apos; is 135 degs length 1.41 (sqrt(2)).  
          This correct vector can be obtained by producing the virtual point F&apos;, which is 
          defined as “where would F be if there hadn’t been a jump”.

          <para>The contouring subroutine CONREC does not assume anything about the device that will
            be used to plot the contours. It instead expects a user written subroutine called
            VECOUT. CONREC calls VECOUT with the horizontal and vertical coordinates of the start
            and end coordinates of a line segment along with the contour level for that line
            segment. In the simplest case this is very similar to the usual LINE (x1,y1)-(x2,y2)
            command in BASIC. See the source code listing below.</para>

          <para>As already mentioned the samples of the three dimensional surface are stored in a
            two dimensional real array. This rectangular grid is considered four points at a time,
            namely the rectangle d(i,j), d(i+1,j), d(i,j+1), and d(i+1,j+1). The centre of each
            rectangle is assigned a value corresponding to the average values of each of the four
            vertices. Each rectangle is in turn divided into four triangular regions by cutting
            along the diagonals. Each of these triangular planes may be bisected by horizontal
            contour plane. The intersection of these two planes is a straight line segment, part of
            the contour curve at that contour height.</para>

            For cases d and h the two planes intersect along an edge of the triangle and therefore
            line is drawn between the two vertices that lie on the contour level. Case e requires
            that a line be drawn from the vertex on the contour level to a point on the opposite
            edge. This point is determined by the intersection of the contour level with the
            straight line between the other two vertices. Cases c and f are the most common
            situations where the line is drawn from one edge to another edge of the triangle. The
            last possibility or case g above has no really satisfactory solution and fortunately

          <para>On occasion users have reported gaps in their contour lines, this should of course
            never happen. There is however a pathological case that all local contouring algorithms
            suffer from (local meaning that they only use information in the immediate vicinity to
            determine the contour lines). The problem arises when all four vertices of a grid cell
            have the same value as the contour level under consideration. There are a number of
            strategies that can be employed to overcome this special event, the correct way is to
            consider a larger region in order to join up the contours on either side of the problem
            cell. CONREC doesn&apos;t do this and just leaves the cell without any contour lines thus
            resulting in a gap. This special case essentially never happens for real values data, it
            is most commonly associated with integer height datasets. The simplest solution is to
            offset the contour levels being drawn by a very small amount.</para>

              number of course/speed changes). Consequently an Alteration Leg doesn&apos;t just have
              values for vehicle state at either end, it is expressed as a series of vehicle states

            <title>Reference contribution</title>

            <para>This type of contribution represents some known fact about the vehicle. It may
              include max/min attainable speed, max/min acceleration and deceleration rates, and
              max/min turning circles. These contributions are normally time independent, and
              typically only have hard constraints. Reference contributions are typically only
              effective in constraining the problem space, they do not assist in the assessment of
              candidate solutions. An example of a reference contribution is the Vehicle Performance
              Reference Contribution.</para>

            <para>In implementation, it is expected that a ‘library&apos; of reference data be made
              available to the analyst. The analyst may load a contribution from the library, but
              changes made to that contribution would only be made locally - the library would
              remain unchanged.</para>

          <section>
            <title>Forecast Contribution</title>

            <para>This type of contribution represents an analyst&apos;s forecast of vehicle behaviour.
              The forecasts are typically time bounded. They normally have estimates, and may also
              have hard constraints: “the vehicle is probably travelling between 4 and 6 knots. It
              is certainly not travelling outside 2 and 10 knots”. These contributions are probably
              to be used in both constraining the problem space and assessing candidate solutions.
              Examples of a forecast contribution are the Speed Forecast Contribution and the
              Straight leg forecast contribution.</para>

            <title>Measurement contribution</title>

            <para>This type of contribution represents some measurement on the vehicle, such as that
              produced by a radar or sonar. The contribution is a time-stamped collection of
              measurements. Hard constraints may apply to error ranges on the sensor (bearing or
              range, for example). The measurement itself is interpreted as an estimate. An example
              of measurement contribution is the Bearing Measurement Contribution. The analyst
              should be provided with a means of suppressing some measurements. In the
                <application>Debrief</application> implementation it is proposed that this is done
              by setting them to not visible in the Outline View.</para>

            <title>Analysis contribution</title>

            <para>This type of contribution uses algorithms to either constrain the problem space,
              or assess the performance of a candidate solution - they contain no attributes. These
              contributions may not have to be explicitly specified by an analyst - they may be
              permanently present. An example of an analysis contribution is the Speed Analysis

              <listitem>
                <para>The system then repeatedly applies the analysis contributions, reference
                  contributions, forecast contributions until the bounded vehicle state becomes
                  stable. We repeatedly run through the contributions since some of them are capable
                  of generating new bounded vehicle constraints - to which hard constraints present
                  in forecast contributions and reference contributions should be applied. Any
                  changes in contributions then need to be processed by the analysis contributions.

            <title>Collate optimal solutions</title>

            <para>It is expected that the system will generate and investigate many, many solutions.
              For some scenarios there may be one (or few) solutions with very high performance.
              These can be presented directly to the analyst for consideration. For other scenarios
              there may be many solutions that offer a similar performance result. It is proposed
              that the system has a means by which it offers distinct solutions to the analyst, in
              order to further refine the contributions. Such processes could include:<variablelist>
                <varlistentry>

                  <listitem>
                    <para>The system could examine the solutions, and highlight those that have have
                      extremes of course, speed, location within the bounded vehicle states. For
                      these extreme solutions the system could show how particular contributions
                      ‘contributed&apos; to their performance score - to allow the estimate or hard
                      constraints on those contributions to be relaxed/tightened.</para>

                      accordingly to either tighten the space, or loosen the space to allow fresh

            <para>A measured contribution may be able to inspect its measurements in conjunction
              with the bounded vehicle states and determine that one of the legs is actually
              comprised of a combination of straight and alteration legs. For example, a measured
              frequency contribution may be able to recognise that a single leg is actually
              comprised of a straight leg, an alteration leg then another straight leg. Similarly, a
              contribution may be able to determine that an alteration leg actually contains a
              period of steady course and speed - and insert a straight leg covering that period.
              Note: if the leg has been created through an analyst&apos;s Straight leg forecast
              contribution specified as a hard-constraint then the leg will not be
              decomposed.</para>

              <title>Bearing-based MDA</title>

              <para>As two vessels move past each other, the bearings typically follow a fairly
                smooth/regular curve. Below is a very poor representation, but it is possible to
                produce a mathematical smoothing of the bearing curve representing “sensor and
                subject in steady state”. When the bearings start to diverge from this curve then
                something has changed - either the sensor or subject have changed their course/speed
                vector. The only input necessary for this is the bearing data. But, it&apos;s of note
                that only the BearingMeasurementContribution knows the actual bearings, they&apos;re not
                visible outside. So, I believe the bearing-based MDA must sit “inside” the
                BearingMeasCont.</para>

                <para>While Bearing based MDA worked effectively with simulated data, it proved
                  unable to recognise manoeuvres in real data.  The simulated data typically had 3
                  decimal places of degrees bearing. But, our real world bearing typically only have
                  one or zero decimal places - and the algortihms were unable to work with this low
                  fidelity.</para>

                course bounds 040-080, then a series of states with a bounds 110-150. Clearly there
                must be a subject vehicle manoeuvre in between these states.</para>

        <para>Of the two phased approach to SATC, the second page - consider candidate solutions has

          <title>Brute Force</title>
          <para>The first strategy considered involved Brute Force.  The algortihm steadily
            progressed through all possible permutations, exhaustively considering performance of
            each one, and finally producing an optimal result.  This straightforward method was easy
            to implement, and proved useful in the early implementation phases.  But, as we strove
            for greater fidelity in solution produced the grids of candidate start/end points got
            tighter and tighter, giving an exponential explosion in the volume of processing to be
            conducted.</para>

          <title>Simulated Annealing</title>
          <para>After we had reached the limits of how much the Brute Force Algortihm could be
            performance optimised, we needed to consider optimisation technique in order to get
              <emphasis>good enough</emphasis> solutions in a reasonable time frame.</para>
          <para>The first technique considered was Simulated Annealing. In this technique a function
            is produced that is able to produce a candidate solution.  This function contains a
            temperature variable.  At the start of processing this variable is high, which allows
            for a great variety of solutions considered. As it cools, it reduces the allowable
            changes in the solution. </para>
          <para>This algorithm gave a significant performance improvement in generating solutions,
            and carried a lot of hope.  But, it fell short in not giving the necessary degree of
            control when it came to ensuring that consecutive legs were coherent with each other, as
            explained below in <xref linkend="inconsistent_range"/>. </para>

            <para>To allow multiple parallel threads of solution derivation, an Islands Model
              (Multiple-population GA) is used, with synchronized migrations (<link xlink:href="http://tracer.uc3m.es/tws/cEA/documents/cant98.pdf">http://tracer.uc3m.es/tws/cEA/documents/cant98.pdf</link>). This involves several
              separate populations which are optimized in parallel. After each epoch the islands
              exchange chromosomes between each other. Each island is separate GA with its own
              characteristics.</para>

          <title>Fitness function</title>
          <para>As previously explained, each chromosome in GA is a set of straight routes. The
            fitness function starts by verifying that each of these straight routes are achievable.
            If everything is ok it then constructs altering routes (cubic bezier curves) between
            them. The GA fitness score is the sum of two scores:<itemizedlist>
              <listitem>
                <para>a) contributions scores for straight and altering routes</para>
              </listitem>
              <listitem>
                <para>b) score how altering route is compatible with its previous and next straight
                  routes.</para>
              </listitem>
            </itemizedlist></para>
          <para>The detail of the a) scores is described in the
              <application>Debrief-SATC</application> contribution documentation.</para>
          <para>Score b) is very effective in producing a solution that is the sum of consistent
            straight line legs. It&apos;s quite easy for the GA to produce a solution that is the
            collection of the best performing individual legs, but where the legs aren&apos;t consistent
            with each other. In <xref linkend="inconsistent_range"/> it is clear that whilst the
            green and purple legs are both valid, they aren&apos;t consistent with each other.</para>

            true ("SUBJECT") track - that requires further contribution from the analyst. But, the
            legs in the solution route are consistent with each other.</para>
          <para>To score how well altering route is compatible with its previous and next straight
            routes the GA fitness function uses speed changes during alteration.</para>
          <para> A smooth speed plot (without peaks) is the best situation (<xref linkend="speed_plot"/>), peaks which are near to previous and next speed are worse but

        <para>The display of chart data in Debrief is all down to the <link xlink:href="http://geotools.org/"><citetitle>GeoTools</citetitle></link> library.
          Recently the SWT module was added to this library. The SWT module incorporates the
          SwtMapPane class upon which the Debrief plot now sits. With the incorporation of GeoTools
          brings a wide range of new file formats, both image and vector, plus more advanced
          topographic and earth model related capabilities. Rest assured, Debrief will exploit these
          library features as much as possible in coming months/years.</para>

            predecessor to Debrief, with the initial Debrief software being created to analyse ASSET
            simulation results. Quickly it was recognised that Debrief could also be usefully
            employed in the analysis of real exercise tracks. Aaah, how close we came to not having

        <glossterm>Dead reckoning</glossterm>

        <glossdef>
          <para>Dead reckoning (DR) is the process of estimating one&apos;s current position based upon a
            previously determined position, or fix, and advancing that position based upon known or
            estimated speeds over elapsed time, and course. Debrief plots tracks in DR mode by
            plotting the positions as a series of course/speed legs from an origin. Debrief plots
            lats/longs unchanged when in <glossterm linkend="g_OverTheGround">Over the

        <glossdef>
          <para>Each of the display modes used on the Debrief plot represents a different method of
            stepping through the plot. When in the normal mode each track is shown in full, with a
            highlight drawn over the current point (as indicated in the Tote). When in snail mode
            only the current point plus an optional back-track is plotted.</para>

        <glossdef>
          <para>The Earth Model used by the application is modular and interchangeable. In the
            initial release of the application the calculations use the Rhumb-Line Formulae, as
            described in &apos;Admiralty Manual of Navigation, Volume 2, 1973&apos;. Short-distance sailing is
            defined as "the following of a rhumb-line track for a distance not greater than

          <para><link xlink:href="http://github.com">GitHub.com</link> is a web-site providing a

        <glossdef>
          <para>The highlighter is the graphic used to indicate the current point on a track. Use of
            different highlighters allows range rings or a vessel-specific symbol to be plotted at

        <glossdef>
          <para>A collection of objected plotted on the <application>Debrief</application> Plot.
            Each layer can be switched on and off individually using the Outline View (see <xref linkend="layer_mgr"/>). When written to a plot-file, each layer is stored separately -
            making it quite easy to copy individual layers out of a plot-file using a text-editor
            and collating them into a new file. (An example of this would be drawing exercise areas
            into one session, then moving them all into one layer, save the file to disk, copy this
            layer to a file of its own, then dropping this file of exercise areas into new files -
            an example of this is in the VPF best-practice, <xref linkend="vpf_how_to"/>)</para>

          <para>Under CinCFleet, the Maritime Warfare Centre (MWC) is a &apos;one-stop shop&apos; for the
            evolution and dissemination of maritime/joint doctrine and concepts through teaching,
            tactical development, operational analysis, force development and wargaming.</para>

          <para>It also provides the focus for the development and practice of operational level
            warfighting, planning and decision making.</para>

          <para>The MWC was formed on 1 October 1995 merging the activities of the Maritime Warfare

        <glossdef>
          <para>A series of time-related text messages. Typically these may represent the narrative
            recorded in a control room during an exercise, but alternatively they may contain a
            series of status messages retrieved from a sensor or weapon. All that is required is
            that the message have a DTG attached and that it may be represented in text form.</para>

        <glossdef>
          <para>In 2015 support for Natural Earth data was added to Debrief. Natural Earth
            is a public domain, freely available dataset of Vector and Raster data. To support
            Debrief analysts a customized version of Natural Earth has been produced that is 
            compliant with the Mercator Projection, and styled suitably for the maritime domain.

          <para>Plotting a Debrief track using the recorded sensor positions. Whilst Debrief stores
            course and speed data, and uses their values in calculations, they do not contribute to
            how the positions are plotted. Debrief plots a track using course and speed data when in

        <glossdef>
          <para>A zoomed out plot showing the full dataset currently loaded. Double clicking on this
            plot forces the main plot to re-centre on the selected point, and dragging an area on
            this plot forces the main plot to zoom in on the selected area. The formatting on the
            overview chart is identical to (and unchangeable from) that on the main plot, with the
            exception that text is not plotted - to reduce clutter.</para>
        </glossdef>
      </glossentry>

      <glossentry xml:id="g_perspective">
        <glossterm>Perspective</glossterm>

        <glossdef>
          <para>Each Workbench window contains one or more perspectives. A perspective defines the
            initial set and layout of views in the Workbench window. Within the window, each
            perspective shares the same set of editors. Each perspective provides a set of
            functionality aimed at accomplishing a specific type of task or works with specific
            types of resources. For example, the <guibutton>Tactical Analysis</guibutton>
            perspective combines views that you would commonly use while editing analysing tactical
            files, while the <guibutton>Contact Ork</guibutton> perspective would help aliens
            (typically named Mork) in contacting their mother planet - together with the VOIP
            software link direct to Orson. As you work in the Workbench, you will probably switch
            perspectives frequently, especially if you&apos;re having Mindy trouble.</para>

          <para>Perspectives control what appears in certain menus and toolbars. They define visible
            action sets, which you can change to customize a perspective. You can save a perspective
            that you build in this manner, making your own custom perspective that you can open
            again later.</para>

          <para>You can use the <guimenu>General &gt; Perspectives</guimenu> preference page to open
            perspectives in the same window or in a new window.</para>
