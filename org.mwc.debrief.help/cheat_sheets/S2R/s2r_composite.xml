		<intro>Before running through this cheat-sheet, you should have already completed the <b>A
			Debrief walkthrough</b> cheatsheet, so you know how to configure Debrief and load
			your data.<i>NoPrint</i> Click on <b>Restore Welcome</b> at
			the top of this window (or select <b>Welcome</b> from the Help menu), navigate to the <b>Tutorials</b> tab, and start the Debrief walkthrough.<i>NoPrint</i> If you haven&apos;t done this, please do so before attempting this tutorial.

				<b>Frequently, before you can start work on producing the red track, you must
					perform some grooming of the ownship track.</b>
			</intro>
			<onCompletion> In that task, you fixed some jumps in the ownship track, and filled in a
				period of missing data. You won&apos;t need the current plot for the next stage of
				the tutorial, so you can close it (by clicking in the &apos;x&apos; in its title
				tab) - and no, you won&apos;t need to save changes. </onCompletion>

			<intro> Now it&apos;s time to start building the target track </intro>
			<onCompletion> You&apos;ve now learnt how to create and manage target tracks in Debrief. </onCompletion>
			<task kind="cheatsheet" name="Load and groom sensor data" skip="false">
				<intro> Now we&apos;ve learned about how to groom data by drag and dropping segments
					we&apos;re going to encounter the <b>Grid Editor</b> - a Debrief panel dedicated
					to editing raw data. </intro>
				<onCompletion> We&apos;ve now got a track with lovely smooth sensor data. Hmm. </onCompletion>

				<intro> The next step of the analysis process is to produce a valid target track

				<intro> Next we&apos;re going to combine the discrete track segments into a tidy

				<onCompletion>You have now completed the <b>Single-sided reconstruction</b> using Debrief tutorial. I hope you can see how easy it is to use Debrief, as well as
					appreciate the power and potential it offers for working with your data. The next
					tutorial takes us to the next step and walks us through a <b>Semi-automatic Target
					Motion Analysis</b> scenario. </onCompletion>
