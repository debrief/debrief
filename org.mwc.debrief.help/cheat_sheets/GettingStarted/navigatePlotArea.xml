		<description>In addition to using the mouse to move around the plot area, there are other
			ways of navigating, including using the tab key to cycle through the 5 drag modes (the 5
			buttons to the left of the Zoom in button on the main toolbar); or, if you have a mouse
			with a wheel, you can press the <b>Ctrl</b> key and then use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out
