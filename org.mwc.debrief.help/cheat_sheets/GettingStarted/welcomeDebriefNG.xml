		title="Background Information">
		<description>Debrief was developed in the mid 90&apos;s by the Maritime Warfare Centre in
			Portsmouth UK to support the analysis and reporting of maritime tactical exercises, and
			is a free, open source application that makes it possible for analysis organisations to
			run open contests for support and development contracts to maintain or extend Debrief.

		title="Document Conventions">
		<description>The following conventions are used within the tutorial:<br/>• <b>Bold</b> is used
			to identify commands, verbal instructions and other essential information, such as user
			interface (UI) details/buttons/names, and for emphasis.<br/>• “<b>Bold + quotes</b>”
			are used to identify filenames and other external references.<br/>• “Quotes” are used
			to highlight comments in examples.

		title="Navigating within Debrief">
		<description>When you&apos;re navigating within Debrief you will need to click on menus,
			sub-menus, and even sub-sub menus. However, though writing it out as “Click on
				<b>File</b> on the menu bar, then click on <b>Save As</b>, and finally <b>navigate
				to where you want to save your file</b>,” is descriptive and accurate, it&apos;s
			pretty laborious and wasteful; so, we shorten it and write it as: <b>File</b> > <b>Save
				As</b> > <b>file location</b>
			<b/>That&apos;s far more succinct and easier.
