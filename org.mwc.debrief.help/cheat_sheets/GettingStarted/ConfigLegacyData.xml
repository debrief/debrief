	<intro>
		<description>In addition to plotting your recorded vehicle data, Debrief is able to show a
			number of datasets in backdrop form. In the past we offered the Vector Product Format
			(VPF) vectored dataset and the ETOPO-2 gridded bathymetry, but these have now been
			superseded by the shiny new &apos;Natural Earth.&apos;

		title="Obtaining the Natural Earth dataset">
		<description>Debrief contains a low resolution &apos;Natural Earth&apos; dataset, sufficient to
			provide coastlines and country boundaries. <br/>However, you can make your analysis
			plots much more attractive by configuring higher resolution data. <br/>Your workplace
			may already have a network copy of &apos;Natural Earth&apos; but, if your IT security policy allows it, you will get better
			performance by copying the data to your hard drive. <br/>If you don&apos;t have access to a
			copy, you can download it from <b>https://github.com/debrief/NaturalEarth</b> by
			clicking on the <b>Download zip</b> button (file size is approximately 25 MB). <br/>Once
			you have downloaded the file, just unzip it in the normal way and save it to a safe
			location on your hard drive.
