   <intro>
      <description>Debrief NG stores data in a local folder called <b>Project</b>. You place analysis files and links to existing data folders on your machine/network into this folder. This tutorial will lead you through creating a new, blank project.

   <item title="Check you need a project">
      <description>If you have to create a project, please move on to the next step. If the
            <b>Navigator</b> view is empty, then you will need to create a new project. If the
         window already contains a folder icon (possibly containing sample data), then you&apos;re
         ready to go and can move on to the next cheat sheet.</description>

           <br/><b>3.</b> The <b>New Project wizard</b> will open:<br/><b>4.</b> Click on the <b>General</b>
         folder, then select <b>Project</b>.<br/><b>5.</b> Click on the <b>Next</b> button. You will now <b>Create
         a new project resource</b>.<br/><b>6.</b> Enter a name for your project (perhaps the name of
         the current exercise, or another meaningful name).<br/>If you&apos;re in a workplace where
         users are unable to create folders in their home directory, clear the <b>Use default location</b>
         checkbox, and <b>Browse</b> to a folder in your personal working directories. (Note: you can
         ignore &apos;Working Sets&apos; for now).<br/><b>7.</b> Click on the <b>Finish</b> button.<br/>You
         will see the new project in your workspace.</description>
