   <intro>
      <description>Debrief NG stores data in a local folder called <b>Project</b>. You place analysis files and links to existing data folders on your machine/network into this folder. This tutorial will lead you through creating a new, blank project.

   <item title="Check Navigator is open">
      <description>In the top left hand corner of Debrief you should find the <b>Navigator</b> view. If it is open, close it; if it isn't there these next steps will show you how to open it:        
         <br/><b>1.</b> click on <b>Window</b> on the menu bar         
         <br/><b>2.</b> mouseover or click on <b>Show View</b>
         <br/><b>3.</b> click on <b>Navigator</b>
         <br/>The <b>Navigator</b> view will then appear. A much faster (old school) alternative is to use key stroke sequences on your keyboard to perform specific actions.

      <description>
         If you're an old school type who, like me, prefers to use the keyboard where possible, then you can use what are called keyboard combinations. 
         Keyboard combinations consist of a sequence of keys which perform a certain action in the program. 
         For example, a common keyboard combination/shortcut in any program is <b>Ctrl+S</b> to quickly save your current document. 
         Similarly, the <b>Navigator</b> can be quickly opened via a keyboard combination:
         <br/><b>1.</b> Press <b>Ctrl+3</b> on your keyboard, and the <b>Quick Access</b> popup dialog will show.
         <br/><b>2.</b> Start typing ‘navigator’ in the dialog box and, before you’ve finished typing the word, you will see <b>Views - Navigator - General</b>; 
         click on it and the <b>Navigator</b> dialog will appear in the top left of your window.
            <br/>The next time you need to do this, press <b>Ctrl+3</b> and you’ll see <b>Previous Choices</b> right under the field where you type - just click on it.

   <item skip="true" title="Other key combinations">
      <description>
         Throughout these cheat sheets, you will see other combinations like:
         <br/><b>•Alt+[key]</b> means <b>press and hold</b> the <b>Alt</b> key and, while it is still pressed, press the other key (or keys).
         <br/><b>•Alt, [key]</b> means you press and release the <b>Alt</b> key and then press the next key(s).
         <br/><b>Note:</b>  sometimes, both variations will work (mainly for common Windows-type tasks), but all programs have their differences.
      </description>
   </item>
   <item skip="true" title="How to find out what the shortcut keys are">
   <description>
      To find out what other shortcut keys work:
      <br/><b>1.</b> Press the <b>Alt</b> key and observe how the letters of each meno item is underlined.
      <br/><b>2.</b> By pressing any one of those underlined letters on your keyboard, the common commands in the corresponding menu will appear.
      <br/>In these drop-down sub-menus, you will see pre-programmed keyboard combinations next to the more popular commands, e.g., in the <b>File</b> menu (<b>Alt, F</b>  or <b>ALt+F</b>) you will see that the shortcut key to <b>Print</b> is <b>Ctrl+P</b> - this is the same in the vast majority of Windows applications. 
      Try and remember these, as they can speed up your work in Debrief.

   <item skip="true" title="Learn about the show view menu">
      <description>If the Navigator view was already open, you may have missed an important feature in Debrief, the <b>Show View</b> menu. Views are supplemental panels that provide additional information (or control) to the conventional 2D Debrief plot, and there are a number of views available.
      </description>
   </item>
   <item skip="true" title="Opening a view">
      <description>
         To open a view:
         <br/><b>1.</b> Click on the <b>Window</b> menu item
         <br/><b>2.</b> Select <b>Show view</b> and a list of Debrief-specific views open.
         <br/><b>3.</b> Click on the view you require to open in it the Debrief window.
         <br/>So, in the future, when you're directed to a view and you can't find it on your screen, just remember you can open any view from this menu.
      </description>
   </item>
   <item skip="true" title="Closing a view">
      <description>
         Views can be closed by clicking on the X icon on their name tab.
      </description>
   </item>
   <item skip="true" title="Moving a view">
      <description>
         Views can also be dragged around, both within Debrief to reposition them, or to a separate external window. When you close Debrief, it remembers the views that were previously open.
      </description>
   </item>
   <item title="Learn about the Quick Access panel">
      <description>
         Alternatively, wherever you are in Debrief, you can open the quick access panel. Just <b>press and hold</b> the <b>Ctrl key</b>, and then press <b>3</b> and a yellow post-it like menu will appear. As you start typing 'Navigator' the list of available commands will reduce until your required view is open. 
         If you prefer to use the mouse, click on <b>Window > Navigation > Quick Access</b>.
         <br/>When you see '<b>menu > sub-menu item > item</b>' in this document, it means click on the first item, then on the second, and so on. I’m sure you’ve seen this before; it’s a much tidier than writing:
         <br/><b>1.</b> Click on <b>Window</b>
         <br/><b>2.</b> Then click on <b>Navigation</b>
         <br/><b>3.</b> and so on...
         <br/>I think you’ll agree that the second method is far more cumbersome. We will still use the second approach for step-by-step procedures, however.

   </item>
   <item title="Check you need a project">
      <description>If you have to create a project please move on to the next step. If the <b>Navigator</b> view is empty, then you will need to create a new project. If the window already contains a folder-icon (possibly containing sample data) then you're ready to go, and can move on to the next cheat sheet.
      </description>
   </item>
   <item title="Create a general project" dialog="true">
      <description>
         To create a 'general' project:
         <br/><b>1.</b> Right-click anywhere in the <b>Navigator</b> view, the <b>New</b> sub-menu will display
         <br/><b>2.</b> Select <b>Project...</b>
         <br/><b>3.</b> The <b>New Project wizard</b> will open
         <br/><b>4.</b> Click on <b>General</b> > <b>Project</b>
         <br/><b>5.</b> Click on the <b>Next</b> button; you will now <b>Create a new project resource</b>
         <br/><b>6.</b> Enter a name for your project (perhaps the name of the current exercise, or another meaningful name).
         <br/>If you're in a workplace where users are unable to create folders in their home directory, clear the <b>Use default location</b> checkbox, and <b>Browse</b> to a folder in your personal working directories
         <br/><b>Note:</b> you can ignore 'Working Sets' for now
         <br/><b>7.</b> Click on the <b>Finish</b> button
         <br/>You will see the new project in your workspace.
