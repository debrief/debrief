	<intro><description>As mentioned previously, Debrief NG stores its data in a local folder called a
		<b>project</b>. While these are frequently created afresh to store new analysis data, it&apos;s
		also possible to denote your existing data directories as sub-folders (via links).<br/>The
		following procedure guides you through generating links to your existing data folders.
		However, if the <b>Create Project</b> form opened when the application started, and if you
		provided both a project name and indicated that you would like sample data to be
		imported, then you can skip the following steps and move on to the next cheat sheet
		(<b>Viewing some data</b>).</description></intro>
	<item skip="true" title="Open Navigator">
		<description>If the <b>Navigator</b> view is closed, open it by using the shortcut key <b>Ctrl</b>+<b>3</b>, and
			then either clicking on the option in <b>Previous Choices</b>, or starting to type
			&apos;navigator&apos; in the search field and clicking on it when it
			appears.</description>
	</item>
	<item skip="true" title="Check you have a workspace">
		<description>Before you can link existing data, you need to define a project for your work.
			If your <b>Navigator</b> view is empty, you must follow the <b>Generating a project for your data</b>
			cheat-sheet (above).</description>
	</item>
	<item skip="true" title="Add a new Folder">
		<description>To add a new folder:<br/><b>1.</b> Right-click on your current project in the
			<b>Navigator</b> view, the <b>New</b> sub-menu will show.<br/><b>2.</b> Select <b>Folder</b> and the <b>New
				Folder</b> wizard will open.<br/>Here though, instead of creating a fresh child folder to store
			our data, we&apos;re going to link to an existing folder.<br/><b>3.</b> In the <b>New
			Folder</b> wizard, click on the <b>Advanced</b> button, and the <b>Advanced options</b> will show.
				<br/><b>4.</b> Select <b>Link to alternate location (Linked folder)</b>.
			<br/><b>5.</b>Click on the <b>Browse</b>... button and navigate to an existing data folder on your machine
			or the network.<br/><b>6.</b> Once complete, click on <b>Finish</b> to close the wizard and
			link to your existing data.<br/><b>Note:</b> if you don&apos;t have your own data, please use
			either of the following:<br/><b>•</b> For a deployed Debrief, use the <b>sample_data</b>
			folder that&apos;s installed in your Debrief installation folder.<br/><b>•</b> If you
			are running a development version of Debrief, use
			<b>org.mwc.cmap.combined.feature/root_installs</b><br/>If you followed these steps, you will have
			created a link to the sample data, however, if you need to load data from other data
			directories, repeat this process as often as is required, but use a shared working
			folder.</description>
