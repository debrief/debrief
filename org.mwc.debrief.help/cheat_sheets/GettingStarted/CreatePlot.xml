<cheatsheet title="Creating a new plot in Debrief">
   <intro>
      <description>This tutorial will guide you through creating a new, blank &apos;plot&apos; in
         Debrief. </description>
   </intro>
   <item title="Check you have a Project">
      <description>&apos;Plots&apos; are stored in &apos;Projects&apos;, so before you create a plot,
         you must have a Project. If you don&apos;t have one, refer to <b>Generating a
            project for your data</b> and follow the steps there. </description>
   </item>
   <item title="Choose location for plot file">
      <description> Debrief will store the new plot in one of your existing folders. If your
         navigator contains links to both shared training data and personal data folders, it&apos;s
         best to create this plot in your personal data folder.</description>
   </item>
   <item title="Create new plot">
      <description>To create a new plot, in the <b>Navigator</b> view:
         <br/><b>1.</b>Right-click on the parent folder for your new plot and select <b>New/Debrief
            Plot</b> to open the Wizard.
         <br/><b>2.</b> Now either confirm the plot save location
         (theplot&apos;s <b>container</b>) or select a different location by clicking on the <b>Browse</b> button
         and selecting the parent folder of your data directories.
         <br/><b>3.</b> Change the
         filename (as required).
         <br/><b>4.</b> Click on <b>Next</b>.
         <br/><b>5.</b> Now, select or
         deselect whether to use the 'Natural Earth' dataset and click on
         <b>Next</b>.
         <br/><b>6.</b> Now you can choose whether or not to <b>add</b> a scale to your plot, with the following options:
         <b>colour</b>, <b>display units</b>, and <b>scale</b> location.
         <br/>If you choose to include a scale, you must enter the display units and scale location before proceeding to the next step.
         <br/><b>7.</b> Next you can choose whether to <b>include a coastline</b> or not. This option is not mandatory.
         <br/><b>8.</b> Clicking on <b>Next</b> takes you to the last step in this process: the <b>Add Grid to Plot</b> dialog box.
         <br/>Here you can select whether to <b>include</b> a grid, the grid <b>colour</b>, whether to show <b>Plot Labels</b>, and the <b>Deltaâ€”grid</b> step size. Once you have selected your options, click on the <b>Finish</b> button. The changes
         will be applied, and the dialog will close.
      </description>
   </item>
   <item title="Finished">
      <description>Your new plot (with the filename you used earlier), will then be displayed in your Debrief window. It is also located in the folder you specified in step 2 (above).
         <br/><b>Note:</b> the wizards make life easier, but all the steps above can be performed from the <b>Chart Features</b> menu in Debrief (<b>Alt,C</b>).
