   <intro>
      <description>
         We&apos;ve got a Debrief plot file pre-prepared to let you avoid 
         some of the steps in the single-leg tutorial, called  <b>L2_Scenario.dpf</b>.
        <br/>
         For this file we have a good set of ownship data for the ownship track, 
         but we didn&apos;t get GPS data for the other participant - though the
         exercise observer did record the platform speed during the trial.

         The data-file for this tutorial is contained in the SATC sub-folder, as were the 
         files used in the previous tutorial.

      <description>         
         Before you load the data-file, close any existing Debrief plots, then drag 
         in the <b>L2_Scenario.dpf</b> data-file from the SATC folder we used in the previous tutorial.
        <br/><br/>
         You will see a Blue Ownship track, with a dark green bearing fan.
