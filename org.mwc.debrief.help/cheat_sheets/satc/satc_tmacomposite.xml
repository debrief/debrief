				Before we get started with loading and manipulating data, we&apos;re

            Ok, that&apos;s the boring school work out of the way. The rest of

            <b>Introduction</b>
            The first tutorial in this set will involve an engagement with just a single leg of target data.

            And that&apos;s the end of the tutorial for single-leg target track

            <intro>
               To be able to save your tutorial data, you need a Debrief
					<b>Workspace</b>
					to store your data in.
					But, if you have a Debrief
					<b>Navigator</b>
					window open, and in it you can see one or more folders in it, you
					can skip this step - and move directly to the <b>Generating links...</b> task.
            </intro>
            <onCompletion>
               You now have a Debrief
					<b>Project</b>
					, to contain your tutorial data.
					<br/><br/>
					There are two ways in which we can load sample data. We will be modifying the
               sample data, so ensure you&apos;re not working on data that is shared with other users
               (the master data). The first thing we need to know is whether your Debrief
               installation folder is on your local machine or on a Network Shared Folder.
			  <br/> • If it&apos;s on a <b>local machine</b> go to <b>Sample Data if Debrief is on a Local Machine</b>
              <br/> • If it&apos;s on a <b>Network Shared Folder</b>, go to <b>Sample Data if Debrief is on a Network Shared Folder</b>.

               <intro>
                  You should have a Debrief project open. You will also need a link to the Debrief
					<b>sample data</b>.
						So, open up the projects in your <b>Navigator</b>
						window, and see if there is a folder titled
						<b>Sample Data</b>
						,
						that contains a folder called
						<b>SATC</b>
						. If there is one there, you can skip this task. But, if you don&apos;t have
						a link to the sample data you will have to create one here.
						<br/>
						But, how you do that depends on your Debrief installation.  If you have
						Debrief installed on your local machine, then you need to do this set of steps.
						However, if you run Debrief from a shared network drive, please jump forward to
						<b>"Sample data from a shared folder"</b>.
               </intro>
               <onCompletion>
                  Ok, you&apos;ve found the Debrief

               <intro>We will now copy in an
                  existing set of sample data from the <b>Debrief\DebriefNG</b> Network Shared
                  Folder.
                 <br/><b>1.</b> Open the <b>Navigator View</b>
                 <br/><b>2.</b> Define a project for your work. This is a
                  parent folder where your data (or links to data) is stored.
                  If your <b>Navigator</b> window is empty, refer to the earlier cheat sheet, <b>Generating a project</b>.
                 <br/>Now we will drag in our data:
                 <br/><b>3.</b> Open Windows Explorer.
                 <br/><b>4.</b> Arrange your windows so
                  you can see both your <b>sample data folder</b> and Debrief.
                 <br/><b>5.</b> Drag the <b>sample data
                  folder</b> from Explorer and drop it into Debrief <b>Navigator</b>.
                 <br/><b>6.</b> A dialog will open asking
                  you if you wish to <b>Copy files and folders</b> or <b>Link to files and folders</b>, select
                  <b>Copy</b>.</intro>
