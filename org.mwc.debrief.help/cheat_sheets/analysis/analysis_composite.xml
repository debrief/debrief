		<intro>
			This tutorial will get you started with some of the analysis
			functionality in Debrief.
		</intro>
		<onCompletion>
			So now you know how to go beyond merely formatting data, you&apos;re
			able to temporally navigate through an encounter, and produce plots
			of data
		</onCompletion>
		<task kind="cheatsheet" name="Using the Outline View" skip="false">
			<intro>
				Firstly, you&apos;ll be using the Outline View to control how much data is
				visible on the plot.
			</intro>
			<onCompletion>Hopefully you found the above steps easy to follow. Controlling what you
				are viewing is an essential component of working effectively with Debrief and an essential skill for both data analysis and collation of information for
				transfer to presentation software like Word or PowerPoint.</onCompletion>

			<intro>
				Debrief has a
				<b>special</b>
				place in its heart for vessel tracks, and provides capabilities to
				allow you to focus your attention on one or more tracks.
			</intro>
			<onCompletion>
				So, you now understand Primary and Secondary tracks. You&apos;re
				practically an analyst!

		<task kind="cheatsheet" name="Controlling time" skip="false">
			<intro>
				Next we&apos;ll delve deeper in the temporal (time) control of track
				data - including different ways to display moving vessel tracks.
			</intro>
			<onCompletion>
				The
				<b>Time Controller</b>
				is a very capable panel that provides a wide range of functionality.
				You&apos;ve now got an idea how to control it.

		<task kind="cheatsheet" name="Producing data plots" skip="false">
			<intro>
				Debrief has lots of embedded functionality that deals with the relationship
				between two tracks: ranges, bearings, range and bearing rates ...
				You can access some of this computational ability by asking Debrief
				to produce plots of your data. You&apos;ll learn how in this cheat
				sheet.
			</intro>
			<onCompletion>
				And that&apos;s all for using Debrief for analysis. If you&apos;re
				from an organisation that conducts TMA analysis based on sensor data
				(or you&apos;ve a general yearning to learn) why not <i>NoPrint</i>go back to the
				<b>Welcome</b>
				page (using the
				<b>Restore Welcome</b>
				link at the top of this view) and<i>NoPrint</i> try the
				<b>Single Sided Reconstruction in Debrief</b>
				tutorial.
