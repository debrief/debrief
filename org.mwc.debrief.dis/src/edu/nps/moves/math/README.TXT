Math Library README

This is a 3-D math library by Kent Watsen, http://www.mbay.net/~watsen

This package contains a variety of 3D classes such as Quaternions, etc.
It may form the basis for a standard 3D math library for Java.

Although there is a vecmath.jar from the Java3D library, the classes in
this package provide convenience methods for performing rotations of
matricies representing 3D entities.
