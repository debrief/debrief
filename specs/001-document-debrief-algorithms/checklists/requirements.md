# Specification Quality Checklist: Document Debrief Algorithms and Tools for Migration

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-02-07
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All 16 checklist items pass validation.
- Spec is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.
- The spec covers the complete 4-phase migration workflow (Discovery, Golden I/O Capture, Specification Authoring, Validation) as defined in the debrief-future LEGACY-REPO-TASK.md and TOOL-LIBRARY-SRD.md guidance documents.
- 18 functional requirements, 8 success criteria, 6 edge cases, 7 assumptions documented.
- No clarification questions needed - the debrief-future guidance documents provide sufficient detail to make informed decisions for all aspects of the feature.
