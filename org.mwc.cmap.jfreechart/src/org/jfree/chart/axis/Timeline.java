/**
 * An interface that defines the contract for a Timeline.
 * <P>
 * A Timeline will present a series of values to be used for an axis. Each
 * Timeline must provide transformation methods between domain values and
 * timeline values. In theory many transformations are possible.
 * <P>
 * A timeline can be used as parameter to a
 * {@link org.jfree.chart.axis.DateAxis} to define the values that this axis
 * supports.
 * <P>
 * Because Timelines were created mainly for Date related axis, values are
 * represented as longs instead of doubles. In this case, the domain value is
 * just the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 GMT as
 * defined by the getTime() method of {@link java.util.Date}.
