      <title>What's new?</title>

      <formalpara>
        <title>Adoption of Eclipse framework</title>

        <para>2006 has seen a change in direction for the delivery of Debrief.
        Instead of being a standalone application build from scratch (albeit
        with a couple of third-party components), Debrief NG has been rehosted
        into an existing framework; <link xlink:href="http://www.eclipse.org"
        xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Eclipse</link>. Adoption of
        Eclipse has bought the following benefits:<variablelist>
            <varlistentry>
              <term>Functionally rich user interface</term>

              <listitem>
                <para>Eclipse has provided a wealth of trees, tables and
                slider controls to make your analysis job easier. You are now
                able to drag &amp; drop any window anywhere on the
                screen.</para>
              </listitem>
            </varlistentry>

            <varlistentry>
              <term>Persistent window layout.</term>

              <listitem>
                <para>Your modified window layout is remembered when you
                re-open Debrief NG.</para>

            </varlistentry>

            <varlistentry>
              <term>Online updating.</term>

              <listitem>
                <para>If you're connected to a suitable network (MWC or the
                Internet) Eclipse is able to download &amp; install its own
                updates. Agencies with large numbers of Eclipse users can
                provide their own internal update site for Eclipse
                installations to download updates from.</para>

              <term>Extensive guidance.</term>

              <listitem>
                <para>Since Debrief sits "on top" of Eclipse, the broad
                spectrum of Eclipse online &amp; printed guidance is
                available. You rely less on Debrief-specific guidance to
                resolve your problems. Don't worry, all of the guidance is
                presented together and covered by a single search
                engine.</para>

            <varlistentry>
              <term>Modular infrastructure.</term>

              <listitem>
                <para>It is now easier to create Debrief plug-ins, and
                applications based on Debrief. Developers no longer have to
                learn the full depth and breadth of Debrief prior to adding
                new features. They just need to learn about the interfaces
                presented by Debrief, and how the Eclipse infrastructure
                works. Eclipse development is documented online and in many
                off-the-shelf books, and it has a strong support
                community</para>

          </indexterm> submarine simulator. In use it quickly became apparent
        that real exercise data could also be viewed in the application
        removing the requirement for clerical staff to produce paper plots for
        use in analysis. The initial version of
        <application>Debrief</application> was a 16-bit MS Windows C++
        application.</para>

        <para><application>Debrief</application> was updated in late 1996 to
        32 bits, in order to exploit the richer user interface components
        available for 32 bit Windows applications. It was at this stage that
        the application was demonstrated and subsequently issued under license
        to <indexterm>

            <secondary>CSDS 12</secondary>
          </indexterm>COMSUBDEVRON 12 of the US Navy.</para>

        <para>In 1999 development of an updated version of
        <application>Debrief</application>, <application>Debrief</application>
        2000 was started. Over the previous four years a number of fresh
        requirements had arisen, requirements which could not be economically
        met using the existing architecture. Accordingly development of the
        <application>Debrief</application> 2000 application started from a
        fresh-whiteboard, adopting a modern modular approach to allow
        incremental implementation and insertion of future modules as they
        were required. The rapid maturity experienced by Java together with
        the availability of cheaply available development environments, rich
        application libraries (serialisation, Java3D and XML in particular)
        and its platform independence made Java the natural choice for the
        application.</para>

        <para>During 2000 <application>Debrief</application> gained wider use
        within the Maritime Warfare Centre, being used for more varied types
        of submarine exercise analysis together with analysis in
        surface-related warfare areas.</para>

        <title>The switch to Open Source</title>

        <para>In Summer 2000 the Maritime Warfare Centre committed to

            <primary>Open Source</primary>

              to identify and correct bugs (provided they have sufficiently
              trained staff). The licensing is such that these modifications
              can be again made public through the re-insertion into the

              this will spread the name of the organisation together with

        <para>At the end of 2000, Ian Mayo, the developer and project manager
          (see <xref linkend="contact_details" />) of <application>Debrief</application>,
        left full-time employment at the Maritime Warfare Centre to setup his
        own software development consultancy, <indexterm>
            <primary>PlanetMayo</primary>
          </indexterm>PlanetMayo Ltd.</para>

        <para>A competitive open tender process was conducted during late 2001
        to supply the Maritime Warfare Centre with
        <application>Debrief</application> support. The contract was won by
        PlanetMayo, who grouped up the implementation of the MWC's fresh
        requirements in a major update to <application>Debrief</application>,
        titled <application>Debrief 2001</application>. This update bought
        new, large areas of functionality to
        <application>Debrief</application> including vectored chart data,
        display of narrative text, and display of sensor-data.</para>

        <para>Debrief development continued in 2002, with the update to
        <application>Debrief 2002</application>, which bought greatly improved
        3-d plotting facilities and a number of incremental improvements to
        other areas of functionality.</para>

        <para>The year 2002 also saw the first conference paper extolling the
        virtues of Debrief and the Open Source principles behind it, at
        <indexterm>
            <primary>UDT</primary>
          </indexterm>Undersea Defence Technology 2002 in La Spezia, Italy.
        The paper itself is available for viewing at the <link
        xlink:href="http://www.debrief.info"
        xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Debrief web
        site</link>.</para>

        <para>Another significant step forward for Debrief in 2002 was the
        contribution from <indexterm>
            <primary>NUWC</primary>
          </indexterm> <link linkend="nuwc_address">NUWC</link> of an
        algorithm and code suitable for shifting tracks. NUWC developed a set
        of experimental classes used to perform track shifting (see <xref
        linkend="track_shifting" />). The algorithms used in these classes
        were taken and modified to complement the Debrief look and feel, and
        to provide greater usability resulting in the track-shifting editor
        included in Debrief 2002.</para>

        <para>Through 2003-2007 PlanetMayo has continued to provide MWC with
        contracted support for Debrief. This support has included user
        guidance, bug fixes and addition of new features. Additionally this
        support contract was used to deliver Debrief 2003; (including
        provision of a bathymetric bottom in 3-d views, presentation of TMA
        data, and improved time-variable graphs), and the fundamental rebuild
        of Debrief into Debrief NG (providing a modular architecture ready to
        seamlessly accommodate ad-hoc analysis tools).</para>

        <para>In 2009 MWC extended Debrief to support Single Sided
        Reconstruction, that is the derivation of a Red track from a Blue
        track plus sensor data. These extensions also included Track Grooming
        changes that support the removal of jumps and general data
        smoothing.</para>

          grouped tabs, though views can be dragged to any other location on
          the workbench, or floated above the workbench. Views frequently have
          their own toolbar and drop-down menu providing actions related to
          that particular task. Once selected, views are closed by clicking on
          the white diagonally oriented cross. To re-open a view, or open a
          fresh view select <guimenuitem>Show View</guimenuitem> from the

            <para><indexterm>
                <primary>Editors</primary>
              </indexterm>Any number of editors can be open at once, but only
            one can be active at a time. The main menu bar and toolbar for
            Debrief contain operations that are applicable to the active
            editor. Initially the active editor will always be the Debrief
            plot, but the extensibility of Debrief NG means other types of
            editor can be implemented. Tabs at the top of the editor area
            indicate the names of files that are currently open for editing
            (<filename>Sample.xml</filename> in the previous screenshot). An
            asterisk (*) indicates that an editor has unsaved changes. By
            default, editors are stacked in the editor area, but you can
            choose to tile them (by dragging the tabbed plot-name) in order to
            view source files simultaneously.</para>

            <title>Views</title>

            <para><indexterm>
                <primary>Views</primary>
              </indexterm>Views support editors and provide alternative
            presentations as well as ways to navigate the information in your
            Workbench. For example, the Navigator displays projects and other
            resources that you are working with (see <xref
            linkend="navigating_debrief" />), and the Layer Manager shows a
            list of selectable items within the current plot (see <xref
            linkend="layer_mgr" />).</para>

            <para>Views also have their own drop-down menus. To open the menu
            for a view, click the icon at the right end of the view's title
            bar. Some views also have their own toolbars. The actions
            represented by buttons on view toolbars only affect the items
            within that view.</para>

            <para>A view might appear by itself, or stacked with other views
            in a tabbed notebook. You can change the layout of a perspective
            by opening and closing views and by docking them in different
            positions in the Workbench window. We've attempted to provide a
            logical arrangement of Debrief views, but feel free to experiment.
            Debrief will remember your settings, but you can return to the
            defaults at any point by selecting <guimenuitem>Reset
            Perspective</guimenuitem> from the <guimenu>Window</guimenu>
            menu.</para>

          <sect3 xml:id="debrief_toolbars">
            <title>Toolbars</title>

            <para>There are four kinds of toolbars in Debrief.</para>

            <para>The main toolbar, sometimes called the Workbench toolbar, is
            displayed at the top of the Workbench window directly beneath the
            menu bar. Items in the toolbar might be enabled or disabled based
            on the state of either the active view or editor. Sections of the
            main toolbar can be rearranged using the mouse.</para>

            <para>There are also individual view toolbars, which appear in the
            title bar of a view. Actions in a view's toolbar apply only to the
            view in which they appear. Some view toolbars include a Menu
            button, shown as an inverted triangle, that contain actions for
            that view.</para>

            <para>Whilst Debrief doesn't currently make use of Perspectives
            (see <xref linkend="perspectives_note" />), a third type of
            toolbar is the perspective switcher. The perspective switcher
            allows quick access to perspectives that are currently open. It
            also has a button that can open new perspectives. The perspective
            switcher is normally located in the top-right, next to the main
            toolbar. However, it is also possible to position it below the
            main toolbar ("top-left"), or to position it vertically on the
            left-hand side of the workbench ("left"). The name of the
            perspectives is shown by default, but it is possible to hide the
            text and show only the icons. To reposition the perspective or
            hide the text, right-click on it and choose the appropriate item
            from the context menu. When Debrief contains modules for Track
            Reconstruction it would be understandable for a Track
            Reconstruction perspective to provide a suitably tailored set of
            views.</para>

            <para>Finally, the fast view bar is a toolbar that contains icons
            representing the current set of fast views. A fast view is a
            shortcut to a view that is frequently used - generated by
            right-clicking in a view's title bar. The fast view bar appears in
            the bottom left corner of the workbench by default. However, it is
            possible to position it on the left or right as well. In all
            cases, you can find out what toolbar buttons do by moving your
            mouse pointer over the button and reading the tooltip that opens.

                    </indexterm>Each Workbench window contains one or more
                  perspectives. A perspective defines the initial set and
                  layout of views in the Workbench window. Within the window,
                  each perspective shares the same set of editors. Each
                  perspective provides a set of functionality aimed at
                  accomplishing a specific type of task or works with specific
                  types of resources. For example, the Tactical Analysis
                  perspective combines views that you would commonly use while
                  editing analysing tactical exercises. Perspectives control
                  what appears in certain menus and toolbars. They define
                  visible action sets, which you can change to customize a
                  perspective. You can save a perspective that you build in
                  this manner, making your own custom perspective that you can
                  open again later. You can use the

          <para>Note that the Replay file format just stores sensor readings,
          it does not store any formatting details. Thus, any formatting
          applied to a plot cannot be saved as a Replay file. Thus, Debrief
          has its <emphasis>Debrief File Format</emphasis>. This is a more
          complex file format that stores a wide range of data-types,
          formatting instructions, and user-interface settings (such as the
          current viewport on the data).</para>

          <para>Thus, whilst you may load data from a
          <emphasis>.REP</emphasis> Replay file, any modifications made to the
          plot must be stored in a Debrief plot file
          (<emphasis>.xml</emphasis>). No changes are save to REP files by the
          Debrief plot editor (though it possible to make textual changes to
          REP files using Debrief's built-in text editor). XML is a file
          format capable of storing structured information in predefined
          types, as in the following example:<programlisting width="70">&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?&gt;

            <para>For most of Debrief's operations (such as adding drawing
            features) it needs to have an area to look at. When re-opening an
            existing plot file, or importing data, Debrief can determine the
            area covered by the plot. However, when starting a new, blank
            session, Debrief does not know what area to cover. In this
            circumstance Debrief sets the origin to its own origin, at Fort
            Blockhouse, HMS Dolphin, Portsmouth, United Kingdom - the plot
            will be centred approximately on 50 degrees 49 minutes North, 1
            degree 19 minutes West.</para>

          relative position of one track to another using sensor data. This

          <para>Debrief NG provides three modes of track shifting - moving
          individual track segments, moving individual points in a track to
          correct a potentially erroneous data point, moving whole tracks to
          overcome navigational system inaccuracies - such as during a
          plot-lock or tie-in. See the three modes above in <xref
          linkend="toggle_buttons" />.</para>

          <para>A Stacked Dots view is used to show bearing-errors when the
          track-shift is being conducted to line up one or two sets of sensor
          data (see <xref linkend="sensor_data" />). For each sensor bearing
          on a track (see <xref linkend="g_sensor_contact" />),
          <application>Debrief</application> identifies the point on the
          opposing track nearest to that time. Each time the track is shifted
          (dragged) <application>Debrief</application> calculates the error
          between the sensor bearing and the current measured bearing, showing
          these in a plot (bearing error against time).<note
              xml:id="sensor_offset_note">
              <para>A Sensor Offset measurement (see <xref
              linkend="SensorOffsetsEditor" />) is applied to the sensor
              bearing line where there sensor datum is offset from the attack
              datum of the platform</para>
            </note></para>

          <para><application>Debrief</application> displays a symbol for each
          visible sensor data, with the symbol being plotted the same colour
          as the sensor data. When track-shifting a long exercise serial, the
          time-variable plot may become difficult to use due to the y-axis
          always auto-scaling to accommodate all available data. Overcome this
          by instructing Debrief to filter-to-time-period (see <xref
          linkend="filter_to_time_period" />) from the time controller (<xref
          linkend="time_controller" />) for the plot-lock period, thus viewing
          a much smaller data-set in the time-variable plot. Additionally, you
          can zoom in on a particular area (by dragging an area downward and
          to the right) of the time-variable plot for detailed analysis,
          dragging the mouse up and to the left to clear the zoom.</para>

          <para>Note the four modes of drag supported by the bearing error
          view. For the non-translate operations you are still able to perform
          a translate by picking up the track segment at its mid-way
          mark.</para>

          Traditionally MWC pre-process track data to remove jumps and

          Single Sided Reconstruction extensions (see <xref

          perform elementary track operations, including smoothing and removal
          of jumps. One approach to avoiding the jumps commonly associated
          with data from inertial navigation systems is to load the data in DR
          mode (see <xref linkend="import_modes" />). The alternative is to
          move the track before/after the jump to line up the two
          sections.<screenshot>

            display and the plot-highlights, Debrief uses the data values
            recorded on or immediately after the indicated stepper time (see
            the <xref linkend="time_calc" /> for more detail).</para>

          <para>One <glossterm linkend="g_track">track</glossterm><indexterm>
              <primary>Primary track</primary>
            </indexterm> currently loaded is assigned as the Primary track
          (the red track in this instance), and then one or more tracks are
          assigned as <indexterm>
              <primary>Secondary track</primary>
            </indexterm>Secondary tracks. The primary track always shows
          absolute data such as current course, speed and depth. With just a
          single secondary track specified, it also shows relative
          (calculated) data - as illustrated above. The secondary tracks
          always display both absolute data (course, speed, depth), plus the
          relative data respective to the primary. Thus, remember that if you
          want to see the primary track's relative bearing to the secondary,
          make sure there's just the one secondary track selected.</para>

          <para>Not only tracks can be placed on the Tote. Buoyfields and most
          annotations (labels, circles, etc) can also be set as primary or
          secondary track. If no time is available for an annotation it is
          deemed to always be valid, and calculations are shown although the
          time field is displayed as "n/a". However, if the annotation has
          start and end times the tote displays "n/a" when outside that period
          and calculated data when inside it.</para>

          <note>
            <para>It may be useful to remember that the Primary Track is
            usually assigned to the Target, thereby allowing a constant
            display of target bearing and range.</para>

              <para>It is not just tracks that can be added to the Tote,
              experiment with right-clicking on features on the plot and see
              if they have the "Set Primary Track" or "Set Secondary Track"
              commands available (although read the note below about these).
              In this way you can make a timed data point (represented by a
              Circle with a very small radius) the primary track, then add a
              number of vessel tracks as secondary tracks, and then as you
              move through the data you can constantly see the vessel range
              and bearings from this data point. This is particularly useful
              for seeing vessel ranges and bearings from a <glossterm
              linkend="g_sensor">sensor</glossterm> such as a sonar buoy.
              Remember to set the DTG data for the data point to time(s) near
              those of the track - or else in your example
              <application>Debrief</application> will assume the "sonar buoy"

            <para>The plotting mode affects the origin and orientation of the
            plot. In <emphasis>Normal</emphasis> mode the plot viewport stays
            static as the time changes, but if <emphasis>Primary
            Centred</emphasis> is selected, the viewport moves to track the
            primary participant. Beyond that, the <emphasis>Primary
            Oriented</emphasis> mode orients the plot to match the heading of
            the primary track. This mode is particularly useful for presenting
            a scenario from the perspective of the primary participant, but
            the quickly changing orientation can be off-putting.</para>

            <tip>
              <para>Relative Display Mode is particularly useful for analysing
              one vessel trailing another. Make the trailing vessel the
              primary track, and the vessel being trailed the secondary track.
              As you step forward through the serial you will clearly be able
              to see the relative bearing of the contact as held by the
              trailing vessel.</para>

              <para>The sample shown below gives a demonstration of the use of
              this relative mode. You can quickly see that the blue vessel is
              directly ahead of the red trailing vessel, and your use of the
              Range Ring Highlighter gives us a quick indication of range.

            <para>The VCR controls allow you to move forwards and backwards in

            beginning, move a large step backwards, move a small step
            backwards and repeat the last time step continuously (small or
            large step, backwards or forwards). The remaining buttons repeat
            these operations in the "forward" direction. The size of small and
            large steps is controlled by the Time Controller properties

          <note>
            <para><application>Debrief</application> contains a set of 3-d models for vessels most

            <para>Not all objects viewable on the normal 2-d Debrief plot are
            applicable in 3-dimensions, but most are. If one is absent which
            you think would usefully be shown in 3-d then please approach the
            Debrief Project Manager (see <xref linkend="contact_details" />).
            Additionally it is not always clear whether a 2-d item (such as a
            labelled annotation) should be visible in 3-d. Such an instance is
            a labelled annotation added to the 2-d plot to help the
            readability of a plot in a report (for example a label placed on a
            sea-mount). This labelled annotation may just clutter the 3-d
            plot, so Debrief only shows labelled annotations when their symbol
            is visible; change the symbol of a labelled annotation to not
            visible, and it will disappear from the 3-d plot.</para>

          <para>Now re-arrange the 3-d plot and the
          <application>Debrief</application> plot so you have a clear view of
          both, and move the time-stepper forward a single step. You will see
          each 3-d vessel representation move. As you move through the track
          using the button on the Time Stepper, note the highlights on the 3-D
          track moving. Now push the "Step Automatically" button, to make the
          plot step forward on its own, leaving us to play.</para>

          <para>Whilst the plot is stepping forward, switch your attention
          back to the 3-d view. Experiment with using the 3 mouse buttons (or
          two plus the alt-key) and zoom in on the current point on the
          red-track. Learning to coordinate these three operations may seem
          difficult, but you'll soon pick it up.</para>

          <para>The data-file we're using isn't all that interesting in this
          view, since neither participant reacts in response to a depth-change
          from the other. But, 3-d views of real exercise results can be
          particularly insightful, clearly illustrating a weapon losing
          contact of its target due to changing depth layer, or one target
          gaining detections of another as it moves into the same
          layer.</para>

          <para>The current version of the 3D libraries used in this viewer
          contains memory leaks. In general memory leaks are tidied up in each
          revision of Java-3d, so it is in your interest to try to keep up to
          date with the newest releases. <footnote>
              <para>Memory leaks occur when an application allocates memory to
              store data but fails to return the memory after the operation is
              complete. This results in the application's memory allocation
              growing. This may be overcome by exiting and re-starting
              Debrief, during which all allocated memory is cleared, sometimes
              resulting in large memory usage by
              <application>Debrief</application> after viewing several plots.
              This may be overcome by closing and restarting
              <application>Debrief</application> if a noticeable slow-down is
              observed. New libraries will be adopted as soon as a fix is

          <para>The objects in the 3-d plot reflect the structure in the Layer
          Manager. So, to hide/reveal a set of objects in 3-d just switch
          their layer off in the Layer Manager. <tip>
              <para>The objects in the 3-d view are a "cloned" set of the
              objects contained in the Layer Manager at the point at which
              <guilabel>Show 3d View</guilabel> was selected. Thus is it
              likely that moving objects between layers once the 3-d plot is
              open may not be reflected in the 3-d view. If extensive
              restructuring has been conducted in the Layer Manager and you
              wish the 3-d view to reflect this, close and re-open the
              view.</para>

              smoothly with less data, so hide the 2-d bathymetry to remove it

              <para>The 3-d view contains text labels that automatically
              orientate themselves towards the viewer. This orientation is
              computationally expensive (it is not a collection of 3-d objects
              being mathematically re-oriented, but a 2-d image being rescaled
              in 3-dimensions). The plot will be significantly slowed down if
              many text labels are set to visible. A good way of overcoming
              this problem is to set the parent layer to not-visible, then
              work through the items on that layer switching the label to not
              visible. Finally switch the layer back to visible. This method
              works quickly because time is not spent</para>

          <application>Debrief</application> also accepts temporal (such as

                        variety of applications and products. VPF allows
                        application software to read data directly from

                        content and is designed to be used with any digital

            </indexterm>data directly from CD-Rom but copying it to your hard
          disk provides the following advantages: <itemizedlist>
              <listitem>

                <para>It allows you to view the contents of multiple CD-Roms
                simultaneously (the VMap level 0 data comes on 4 CDs so unless

                get global coverage)</para>

          <para>So, on the assumption that you do want to copy the data to
          your hard disk, here is a strategy for keeping the data tidy:
          <orderedlist>
              <listitem>
                <para>Create a folder in the top level of your hard disk

              </listitem>

              <listitem>
                <para>Now insert the first VPF CD-Rom and view it through your
                file manager (e.g. <application>Windows
                Explorer</application>). You need to find which directory
                contains the actual data, so have a look in each of the top
                level directories for a directory which contains the files
                <filename>DHT</filename> and <filename>LAT</filename>. Note,
                for VMap data this is a directory named
                <filename>VMAPLV0</filename>. When you've found this directory
                copy it across to the <filename>VPF</filename> directory you
                created on your hard disk.</para>
              </listitem>

              <listitem>
                <para>So for VMap data, your hard disk you should have a
                directory named <filename>VPF</filename>, containing your

                <filename>VMAPLV0</filename>.</para>
              </listitem>

              <listitem>
                <para>You will be copying in a number of data sets with this
                directory name, so rename <filename>VMAPLV0</filename> to the

              </listitem>

              <listitem>
                <para>Next, swap your CD for the next CD in the series, copy
                the directory of interest across to the

          <para>Accordingly, you could create a datafile containing only the

          simplified set of VPF layers.</para>

          <para>When you drag/drop an <glossterm

          copied into the existing session, although the projection, Tote, and
          GUI parameters are ignored.</para>

        <sect2 xml:id="vpf_how_to">
          <title>How to do it - 1</title>

          <para>So what you do is open a new
          <application>Debrief</application> session and load the smallest REP
          file you have into it - (just to give your data an "origin").</para>

          <para>Then add your VPF layers using the <guibutton>Create VPF
          Layers</guibutton> button on the <guilabel>Chart Features</guilabel>
          toolbar. Customise these layers so that the layers/features of
          interest are made visible and set to your desired colours.</para>

          <para>Finally save the view to a plot file in an easily accessible
          location - call it <filename>default_layers.xml</filename></para>

          <para>As you can see above, the file starts with an entry beginning
          with the characters <guilabel>&lt;?xml</guilabel>. This line
          indicates that you are handling <glossterm
          linkend="g_xml">XML</glossterm> data.</para>

          <para>Next you have a series of lines of data, which start with
          <guilabel>&lt;plot&gt;</guilabel> and end with
          <guilabel>&lt;/plot&gt;</guilabel>. This format is similar to that
          found in HTML, and indicates that this file contains details of
          plot. Inside the <guilabel>&lt;plot&gt;</guilabel> you can see a
          <guilabel>&lt;session&gt;</guilabel>, which in turn contains a
          <guilabel>&lt;layers&gt;</guilabel> object, containing a series of
          <guilabel>&lt;layer&gt;</guilabel> items, followed by a
          <guilabel>&lt;projection&gt;</guilabel>, and a
          <guilabel>&lt;gui&gt;</guilabel>.</para>

          <para>What you are going to do is strip out everything except the
          Layers object, and then thin this out.</para>

          <para>So, move the cursor to the <guilabel>&lt;layers&gt;</guilabel>
          line. Delete everything before this (except for the
          <guilabel>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;</guilabel>
          line.</para>

          <para>Now move down to the <guilabel>&lt;/layers&gt;</guilabel>
          line, and delete everything from it to the end of the file.</para>

          <para>As you look at the layers, you can see that each layer has a
          name ( <guilabel>Chart Features</guilabel> is the first one in the
          example above). It is the <guilabel>Chart Features</guilabel> layer
          which you want to keep, so navigate down to the next Layer (which
          may have a track name), and delete that and all others (down to, but
          not including the <guilabel>&lt;/layers&gt;</guilabel> line which
          marks the end of the data).</para>

          <para>Within the <guilabel>Chart Features</guilabel> layer you can
          see an entry named <guilabel>&lt;vpf_database&gt;</guilabel> - this
          is the vpf data. Inside the vpf_database are
          <guilabel>&lt;vpf_library&gt;</guilabel> entries, one for each
          library loaded (probably just VMaplv0 in your instance).</para>

          <para>Inside the <guilabel>&lt;vpf_library&gt;</guilabel> are a
          series of <guilabel>&lt;vpf_coverage&gt;</guilabel> entries. It is
          these which you will thin out. Work down through them deleting any
          you don't want. In your instance you only want to keep the
          boundaries data, so you will delete all other coverages. So, select
          blocks of text beginning with
          <guilabel>&lt;vpf_coverage&gt;</guilabel> and ending with
          <guilabel>&lt;/vpf_coverage&gt;</guilabel> and delete those you
          don't want.</para>

          <para>Finally, delete any &lt;vpf_features&gt; you don't
          want.</para>

          <note xml:id="etopo_description">
            <para>The 'ETOPO-5' data set is originally from the U.S. National
            Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) in Boulder, Colorado (USA), and
            represents the "best" available digital terrain values as
            integrated from existing five and ten-minute digital sources. The
            data set has elevation values spaced at every five-minute
            latitude/longitude crossing on the global grid (approx. nine
            km.-sq. spatial resolution, or 12 x 12 pixels/degree), and a
            one-meter contour interval. Bathymetric values are included in
            this data set, starting at approximately 10,000 meters below sea
            level, while the elevation values extend up to heights of
            approximately 8,000 meters above sea level. Some original sources
            of the data used include the U. S. Defense Mapping Agency for the
            conterminous USA, Japan and Western Europe; the Australian Bureau
            of Mineral Resources, and the New Zealand Department of Scientific
            and Industrial Research.</para>

            <para>GRID has reformatted the original NGDC data file to place
            the origin at 180 degrees West longitude, instead of at 0 degrees
            Greenwich Meridian. The 'ETOPO-5' data file has 2160 records of
            data with a length of 8640 bytes each: the size of the data array
            is 2160 lines by 4320 elements, but this is a l6-bit or two bytes
            per element data file. The origin of the data file is at 90
            degrees North latitude and 180 West longitude, and it extends to
            90 degrees South latitude and 180 degrees East longitude. The data
            file comprises 18.66 Megabytes. The version of this data file at
            GRID has been discovered to contain two records (lines) of flawed
            data values; that is, portions of lines 2055 and 2056, beginning
            at the Weddell Sea north of Antarctica and continuing eastward.
            GRID is currently waiting for a response from the data supplier
            (NGDC) before attempting any replacement of what appear to be
            anomalous data values.</para>

                  be improved by directing the algorithm to skip a number of
                  depth values before performing the next calculation. This
                  may make the contours themselves very slightly more blocky,

              <para>The ETOPO-5 dataset uses a significant amount of memory on

                By keeping the sensor data separate to the vessel data, the
                existing sensor data-file can be dropped into Debrief with the
                updated vessel track-file, allowing the user to perform a

          is stored safely when the Debrief plot is saved, however.</para>

          <para>When Sensor Contact data is being plotted for a Sensor using
          relative coordinates, Debrief reflects a Sensor Offset distance for
          that sensor. The sensor offset distance denotes the horizontal
          distance between the centre of the centre and the attack datum of
          the host platform (+ve forwards, -ve backwards - so towed array data
          would be -ve). See the next section for more detail on the support
          for a shared library of array lengths. The location of the start of
          the sensor contact bearing line is calculated using the current
          value of course for the host platform and the sensor offset
          value.<note>

            </indexterm>When examining a Sensor in the properties view, you
          will see that in addition to Sensor Offset, there is a 'Worm in the
          hole' (see <xref linkend="WormInHole" />). This is typically used
          for towed arrays, whereby the start of the sensor bearing line is
          located at the Sensor Offset distance back along the host platform
          track, instead of in a straight line behind the host.</para>

          <para>Somewhere on your network create a csv-formatted text file
          that stores two columns of data (as shown below). The first column
          is the platform/sensor name, the second column is that combination's
          array offset in metres (with -ve figures at the stern of the host
          platform). The file should end in a csv suffix, and is formatted as

Platform A,-45
Platform B,-124.6
Platform C,-551</screen></para>

              </indexterm>The new <guilabel>Bulk Sensor Manager</guilabel>
            offers an opportunity to determine which sensor data has a
            direction near to one of the other tracks currently loaded in
            Debrief. Before opening the Bulk Sensor Manager it's worth telling
            Debrief which is your 'ownship' track, and which are the tracks of
            interest. Do this by marking tracks as primary and secondary in
            the Track Tote (see <xref linkend="assigning_tracks" />). Once you
            have a primary track set, select <guilabel>Bulk Sensor
            Manager</guilabel> from the <guilabel>Window/Show View</guilabel>
            menu. You'll see a plot like the one below:<screenshot>

            <para>As you'll see, the view shows multiple series of track data.
            Currently visible tracks are displayed in bold lines (the thick
            green line in the screenshot) - so, you'll typically be trying to
            determine which blocks of sensor data are close to/similar to
            target tracks. Sensor data is shown with symbols if it's visible
            in the plot (see the pink line near the centre-left of the image).
            Clicking on a block of sensor data in the view also selects that
            sensor data in the Layer Manager (though on occasion you need to
            expand the <guilabel>Sensors</guilabel> folder in the Layer
            Manager). As blocks of sensor data are selected, they are shown in
            black in the view. Items can be multiple-selected with the
            <keysym>&lt;ctrl&gt;</keysym> key. Once multiple blocks of sensor
            data are selected in the layer manager you can right-click on them
            and select 'Merge sensors into <emphasis>xxxx</emphasis>'</para>

            <para>Also note that whilst by default comes up with a unique
            color/symbol combination for each block of sensor data, you can
            click on the 'Show original colours' palette icon at the top of
            the view. This will switch the Bulk Sensor Manager to using the
            sensor data color as configured via the sensor manager.</para>

            mistakenly assume that the data is all for the same contact: so
            the data will show as a continuous series to the left of the
            chart, then there'll be a jump over to were that track number is
            used again against another contact on the right hand side.</para>

            <para>Debrief offers a tool automatically split sensor data - the
            scissors icon at the top of the Bulk Sensor Manager offers
            'Auto-split sensor segments'. It will pass through all of the
            sensor tracks in the primary track, and if there is a jump of more
            than 15 seconds Debrief splits the successive data into a new
            tracks. The original and new tracks are then renamed with a "_1",
            "_2" suffix.</para>

            <para>As you'll see in the earlier <emphasis>Cumbersome sensor
            plot</emphasis>, a lot of sensor data can make a plot difficult to
            interpret. If sensor data isn't provided with a range attribute,
            then sensor lines are drawn out to infinity (or the edge to the
            viewport - whichever is nearer...). On a large area plot this may
            given sensor lines of 10s of nautical miles long. If in truth the
            detections are only in the thousands of yards, you may wish to
            give the sensor data a range. To do this, start by multi-selecting
            a block of sensor data in the layer manager. Next, open the
            properties window - you'll see the elements have zero range. Just
            insert an 'indicative' value for range. The sensor lines on the
            plot will now be clipped to that range - greatly reducing plot
            clutter.<screenshot>

          <para>There exists the situation in frequency analysis where
          multiple tonals are held, but the analyst would rather use the
          highest freq tonals. Here's a strategy for how to manage it,</para>

          <para>First, load the bearing sensor data. Edit the sensor cuts
          (probably in the grid editor, <xref linkend="GridEditor" />) to
          include the highest freq data held, potentially colouring the blocks
          of cuts according to the base tonal that they relate to. Go through
          these blocks of cuts creating a solution for each block - then
          setting the base frequency for that solution to the respective
          value.</para>

          <para>You can now switch individual solution blocks on and off,
          ensuring the stacked dots (<xref linkend="track_shifting" />)will be

          are used to produce an estimate of range by analysing a sequences of
          sensor contacts which only contain bearing (and optionally range).
          The output of the algorithm is typically a series of estimated
          target locations with optional estimates for course, speed and
          depth. Uncertainty in bearing and range may be indicated by

          Time Controller, though you may type in any time. Follow the steps,
          and when the wizard closes you will have created your TUA ellipse.
          Clearly, if you have lots of TUAs to load, you're better off by

          <para>In addition to being able to display TUAs from third-party TMA
          implementations, Debrief can be used to derive fresh TMA solutions.
          These solutions are not presented in the form of TUAs, but in the
          form of analysis legs: a time-limited track segments comprising a
          series of points at constant course and speed. Traditionally these
          segments are created by analysis of a combination of sonar-derived
          bearings and frequencies.</para>

          <para>These TMA segments are represented as track segments within

              straight-line TMA Segment hot spots.</para>
            </note> When in Translate or Rotate mode, the drag-highlight is
          extended beyond the first/last point in the track to assist with
          alignment. A target-circle is also plotted on this extended stalk.
          This target is plotted at a distance equal to the distance back to
          the end-but-one point. Thus, if you have equi-spaced track data this
          target can be used to align the track sections longitudinally and
          transversely. In the following diagram the lower-right track segment
          is being dragged inline with the upper-left track segment. Place the
          circle/cross hair over the end point of the fixed track to align the
          tracks in both dimensions.<screenshot>

          <para>Note, when the plot is in one of these modes, the operations
          apply to the ends of the track - so the operation is started by
          dragging one end of the track (once the 'selected' hover highlight
          is shown). In addition to the specific operations performed at the
          ends of the target track, all modes support picking up and dragging
          the track when it is picked up at its centre In the Stretch mode the
          track shifts as described above, in all the other modes it is
          translated.</para>

          either create a new account, or login using a number of existing
          login authorities (including Google and Yahoo). Once registered, you
          can click on the 'New Ticket' button, and submit a request for a
          bug-fix or new features. The items are then tracked, and provided an
          e-mail address was provided, the submitter is kept informed of the
          progress of the submission.</para>

          'make the cut'. Once your request is emailed it's recorded on the
          system and an informed debate/discussion can follow. This ensures
          requests don't fall through the cracks.</para>

          however - for all users to share a common Debrief installation. An
          advantage of this scenario is that software updates only need to be
          performed once, at the central location. By default, however, shared
          installations are troublesome for Debrief - since all users will be
          looking at a single set of settings - so administrator participation
          is necessary.</para>

          <para>Whilst a number of theoretical solutions exist for this
          problem, the most reliable solution to emerge is to force Debrief NG
          to use the workspace in the users own login directory (since each
          user has a unique login directory). This also overcomes the
          challenge of new users having to select a workspace before they know
          what a workspace is.</para>

          <para>Thus, the Debrief shortcut (.ini file) has been modified to
          explicitly indicate that the workspace is in the a folder in the
          user login area:<screen>-data
@user.home/.DebriefNG</screen>The '.' character before the DebriefNG folder
          name follows a convention that is normally sufficient to make the
          operating system make the folder hidden by default.<tip>
              <para>When users are upgrading from older versions of DebriefNG,
              the application will ignore the last workspace location, and
              load a new, blank workspace from the new user directory. If the
              user now closes Debrief the workspace data can be copied from
              the old location into the new location, which will get read when
              the application re-opens.</para>
            </tip></para>

        <sect2 xml:id="CentralUpdates">
          <title>Centralised software updates</title>

          <para>In the Autumn 2009 updates Debrief adopted the Eclipse p2
          <emphasis>update</emphasis> mechanism. With this update came support
          for centralised updates. Centralised updates allow updated Debrief
          components to be placed at a central location on shared network
          storage, with individual Debrief installations automatically
          updating from it.</para>

          <para>Start by locating a central shared folder, and creating a
          <emphasis>Repository</emphasis> folder in it. This is where your
          Debrief maintainer will unzip Debrief updates. Next, you must tell
          the individual Debrief installations where the repository is. Do
          this from the <guilabel>Preferences</guilabel>

          Sites</guilabel> dialog:<figure xml:id="ReposLocation">

          read data-files correctly, nor can it populate screen editors. The
          workaround to this problem is to explicitly direct Debrief to
          startup using an English locale. Do this by launching Debrief with
          the "-nl en" command parameter. This can be performed either by
          modifying the shortcut used to start Debrief, or by adding the
          command parameter to the <filename>Debrief.ini</filename>
          configuration file (though this will have to be re-performed after

          This format uses an 80 character string containing data/time, vessel
          name, position, heading, depth and speed. More than one vessel track
          can be stored in each file. The gaps between the data fields can be
          any whitespace characters, that is any number of spaces or tabs, but
          there must be a value for each data field. <note>
              <para>Whilst file formats recorded here are shown against an 80
              character index marker - the fields can be of any width - the
              data is broken down using delimiters, not fixed field
              widths.</para>

          <para>The file-naming convention for files in the <glossterm

          <para>Through an extension to the format, annotation data can also
          be accepted. The annotation data format is described below. Whilst
          annotation and track data may be stored in single file, it is
          recommended that they are stored in separate files, to ease reading
          and plotting track-data only.</para>

          <para>An acknowledged shortcoming of the former file format (
          <filename>dpl</filename>) used in <application>Debrief</application>
          was the frequency with which <application> Debrief</application>
          modifications rendered previous <filename>DPL</filename> files
          unreadable. This use of <application>Java</application>
          serialization offered low cost in development terms and was seen as
          essential to store the more complex data used in
          <application>Debrief 2000</application> (such as projections, and
          formatting data).</para>

          <para>The only way to divorce the <application>Debrief</application>

          format. This independent format must be structured in order to store
          <application>Debrief</application> data tidily, and the development
          to support it must not be too "expensive". The adoption of
          <application> XML</application> meets both of these criteria = it is

              <para>Keyhole Markup Language (KML) is an XML-based language
              schema for expressing geographic annotation and visualization on
              existing or future Internet-based, two-dimensional maps and
              three-dimensional Earth browsers. KML was developed for use with
              Google Earth, which was originally named Keyhole Earth Viewer.
              It was created by Keyhole, Inc, which was acquired by Google in
              2004. The name "Keyhole" is an homage to the KH reconnaissance
              satellites, the original eye-in-the-sky military reconnaissance
              system first launched in 1976. KML is an international standard
              of the Open Geospatial Consortium. Google Earth was the first
              program able to view and graphically edit KML files, and other
              projects such as Marble have also started to develop KML
              support</para>

            </indexterm> Whilst it has military roots, the KML dialect of XML
          has received wide adoption for the recording and distribution of
          positional information. KML extends the GML standard. KML and GML
          provide a number of ways of recording positional data. This section
          will record the KML dialects that Debrief understands.</para>

        <title>Introduction to XML</title>

        <para>Extensible Markup Language ( <glossterm
        linkend="g_xml">XML</glossterm>) is a meta-markup language that
        provides a format for describing structured data. This facilitates
        more precise declarations of content and more meaningful search
        results across multiple platforms. In addition, XML will enable a new
        generation of Web-based data viewing and manipulation
        applications.</para>

        <sect2 xml:id="more_xml">
          <title>Extensible</title>

          <para>In XML you can define an unlimited set of tags. While HTML
          tags can be used to display a word in bold or italic, XML provides a
          framework for tagging structured data. An XML element can declare
          its associated data to be a retail price, a sales tax, a book title,
          the amount of precipitation, or any other desired data element. As
          XML tags are adopted throughout an organization's intranet, and by
          others across the Internet, there will be a corresponding ability to
          search for and manipulate data regardless of the applications within
          which it is found. Once data has been located, it can be delivered
          over the wire and presented in a browser such as Internet Explorer 5
          in any number of ways, or it can be handed off to other applications
          for further processing and viewing.</para>

          <title>Structural representation of data</title>

          <para>XML provides a structural representation of data that has
          proved broadly implementable and easy to deploy. Industrial
          implementations in the Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)
          community and elsewhere demonstrate the intrinsic quality and
          industrial strength of XML's tree-structured data format.</para>

          <para>XML is a subset of SGML that is optimized for delivery over
          the Web; it is defined by the World Wide Web Consortium, ensuring
          that structured data will be uniform and independent of applications
          or vendors. This resulting interoperability is kick-starting a new
          generation of business and electronic-commerce Web
          applications.</para>

          <para>XML, which provides a data standard that can encode the
          content, semantics, and schemata for a wide variety of cases ranging
          from simple to complex, can be used to mark up the following:

            </itemizedlist></para>

          <para>Once the data is on the client desktop, it can be manipulated,
          edited, and presented in multiple views, without return trips to the
          server. Servers can now become more scalable, due to lower
          computational and bandwidth loads. Also, since data is exchanged in
          the XML format, it can be easily merged from different
          sources.</para>

          <para>XML is valuable to the Internet, as well as to large corporate
          intranet environments because it provides interoperability using a
          flexible, open, standards-based format, with new ways of accessing
          legacy databases and delivering data to Web clients. Applications
          can be built more quickly, are easier to maintain, and can easily
          provide multiple views on the structured data.</para>

        <sect2 xml:id="more_xml_data">
          <title>Data is separated from the presentation and the
          process</title>

          <para>The power and beauty of XML is that it maintains the
          separation of the user interface from the structured data. Hypertext
          Markup Language (HTML) specifies how to display data in a browser,
          XML defines the content. For example, in HTML you use tags to tell
          the browser to display data as bold or italic; in XML you only use
          tags to describe data, such as city name, temperature, and
          barometric pressure. In XML, you use stylesheets such as Extensible
          Style Language (XSL) and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to present the
          data in a browser. XML separates the data from the presentation and
          the process, enabling you to display and process the data as you
          wish by applying different style sheets and applications.</para>

          <para>This separation of data from presentation enables the seamless
          integration of data from diverse sources. Customer Information,
          purchase orders, research results, bill payments, medical records,
          catalog data, and other information can be converted to XML on the
          middle tier, allowing data to be exchanged online as easily as HTML
          pages display data today. Data encoded in XML can then be delivered
          over the Web to the desktop. No retrofitting is necessary for legacy
          information stored in mainframe databases or documents, and because
          HTTP is used to deliver XML over the wire, no changes are required
          for this function.</para>

          <para>XML documents are easy to create; if you are familiar with
          HTML, you can quickly learn to create one. In this example, XML is
          used to describe a weather report: <screen>              <markup>
                &lt;weather-report&gt;
                &lt;date&gt;March 25, 1998&lt;/date&gt;
                &lt;time&gt;08:00&lt;/time&gt;

                &lt;region&gt;West Coast&lt;/region&gt;
                &lt;country&gt;USA&lt;/country&gt;

                &lt;skies&gt;partly cloudy&lt;/skies&gt;
                &lt;temperature&gt;46&lt;/temperature&gt;
                &lt;wind&gt;
                &lt;direction&gt;SW&lt;/direction&gt;
                &lt;windspeed&gt;6&lt;/windspeed&gt;
                &lt;/wind&gt;
                &lt;h-index&gt;51&lt;/h-index&gt;
                &lt;humidity&gt;87&lt;/humidity&gt;
                &lt;visibility&gt;10&lt;/visibility&gt;
                &lt;uv-index&gt;1&lt;/uv-index&gt;

                &lt;/weather-report&gt;

        <note>
          <para>The result of this projection algorithm (as with most others)
          is that whilst the information plotted at the centre horizontal
          section (mid-latitude) of the screen is an accurate representation,
          travelling further north and south from it degrades the accuracy.
          This is negligible in data areas near the equator or where only a
          small area is covered (less than a couple of hundred nautical
          miles). With greater data areas, and nearer the poles, the effects
          are more noticeable, however.</para>

          <para>A line on the earth's surface which cuts all meridians at the

          <para>With his knowledge of the distance along a parallel of

          whilst doing so. In <xref linkend="rhumb_line_parts" /> FT is the

              <secondary>Worm in the hole</secondary>
            </indexterm>Frequently vehicles in Debrief use sensors with a
          different datum to the host platform - either because they're
          several metres from the position recorded datum on board the
          platform, or because they're an offboard sensor dragged behind the
          sensor. For an onboard sensor it is acceptable to locate the sensor
          by reference to its sensor length offset in conjunction with the
          current heading. However for an offboard sensor this coarse
          calculation may not be representative of the actual sensor location.
          When a platform is on a straight-line course, it is acceptable to
          plot the sensor datum back along the reverse heading. But, when a
          platform has travelled through a turn, plotting the sensor datum at
          the reciprocal of the platform heading will place the sensor in an
          unrealistic location. To counter this, Debrief offers a 'Worm in the
          hole' sensor locating model.</para>

          <para>The 'worm in the hole' algorithm takes the sensor length
          offset value, and determines the point this specified distance back
          along the platform track. The metaphor is that a worm has opened a
          tunnel through a body of material. The sensor is being dragged
          through this tunnel, and we determine the sensor location
          accordingly.</para>

          <note>
            <para>This is not a perfect algorithm. In truth, during a turn the
            forces on a towed array will cause it to slip sideways, cutting
            off the corner to an extent. It is the responsibility of the
            analyst to appraise himself with array performance and determine
            the applicability of the worm in the hole algorithm - though note
            its results are much more accurate than the non-worm in the hole
            straight line model.</para>
          </note>
        </sect2>

        <sect2 xml:id="WormExample">
          <title>Example</title>

          <para>The screenshot belows shows a comparison of the two models.
          The red ownship track has positions at times 100,200,300 and 400.
          The sensor track has positions at times 100,140,280,350. The array
          is 400m long.</para>

          <para>The two array models show the same value for the first 3
          points plotted: in the first two of these the array falls behind the
          start of the ownship track - thus the reciprocal of ownship heading
          is necessary to determine the position. In the third position, the
          length of the 400m array falls completely within the 600m
          leg.</para>

          <para>The fourth position is, however, different. The straight-line
          model plots it back along the reciprocal of the platform heading at
          time 300. The worm in the hole model, however, turns back along the
          ownship track from position 200 to 300. At time 350, the ownship
          platform will be 1/2 way down between positions 300 and 400 - this
          will consume 1/2 of the 600m separation (300m), leaving another 100m
          of array to be consumed - this the algorithm moves 100m back down
          between the points at 200 &amp; 300.<screenshot>

        <para>The contouring algorithm employed within Debrief was originally
        produced by Paul Bourke back in 1987, for submission to the Byte
        magazine. Here's the article pretty much verbatim:</para>

          <para>Contouring aids in visualizing three dimensional surfaces on a

          In all cases some parameter is plotted as a function of two
          variables, the longitude and latitude or x and y axis. One problem
          with computer contouring is the process is usually CPU intensive and
          the algorithms often use advanced mathematical techniques making
          them susceptible to error.</para>

            </indexterm>To do contouring in software you need to describe the
          data surface and the contour levels you want to have drawn. The
          software given this information must call the algorithm that
          calculates the line segments that make up a contour curve and then
          plot these line segments on whatever graphics device is
          available.</para>

          <para>CONREC satisfies the above description, it is relatively

          <para>The contouring subroutine CONREC does not assume anything
          about the device that will be used to plot the contours. It instead
          expects a user written subroutine called VECOUT. CONREC calls VECOUT
          with the horizontal and vertical coordinates of the start and end
          coordinates of a line segment along with the contour level for that
          line segment. In the simplest case this is very similar to the usual
          LINE (x1,y1)-(x2,y2) command in BASIC. See the source code listing

          surface are stored in a two dimensional real array. This rectangular
          grid is considered four points at a time, namely the rectangle
          d(i,j), d(i+1,j), d(i,j+1), and d(i+1,j+1). The centre of each
          rectangle is assigned a value corresponding to the average values of
          each of the four vertices. Each rectangle is in turn divided into
          four triangular regions by cutting along the diagonals. Each of
          these triangular planes may be bisected by horizontal contour plane.
          The intersection of these two planes is a straight line segment,
          part of the contour curve at that contour height.</para>

          <para>Depending on the value of a contour level with respect to the

          <para>In cases a, b, i and j the two planes do not intersect, i.e.
          no line need be drawn. For cases d and h the two planes intersect
          along an edge of the triangle and therefore line is drawn between
          the two vertices that lie on the contour level. Case e requires that
          a line be drawn from the vertex on the contour level to a point on
          the opposite edge. This point is determined by the intersection of
          the contour level with the straight line between the other two
          vertices. Cases c and f are the most common situations where the
          line is drawn from one edge to another edge of the triangle. The
          last possibility or case g above has no really satisfactory solution

          <para>On occasion users have reported gaps in their contour lines,
          this should of course never happen. There is however a pathological
          case that all local contouring algorithms suffer from (local meaning
          that they only use information in the immediate vicinity to
          determine the contour lines). The problem arises when all four
          vertices of a grid cell have the same value as the contour level
          under consideration. There are a number of strategies that can be
          employed to overcome this special event, the correct way is to
          consider a larger region in order to join up the contours on either
          side of the problem cell. CONREC doesn't do this and just leaves the
          cell without any contour lines thus resulting in a gap. This special
          case essentially never happens for real values data, it is most
          commonly associated with integer height datasets. The simplest
          solution is to offset the contour levels being drawn by a very small
          amount.</para>

      <title>PREAMBLE</title>

      <para>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or
      other written document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure
      everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or
      without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.
      Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way
      to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for
      modifications made by others.</para>

      <para>This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
      works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It
      complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license
      designed for free software.</para>

      <para>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
      free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
      program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
      software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it
      can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
      whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License
      principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.</para>

      <title>APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS</title>

      <para>This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a
      notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under
      the terms of this License. The "Document", below, refers to any such
      manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed
      as "you".</para>

      <para>A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
      Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
      modifications and/or translated into another language.</para>

      <para>A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter
      section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of
      the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
      subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
      directly within that overall subject. (For example, if the Document is
      in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
      any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical
      connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
      commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
      them.</para>

      <para>The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
      titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the
      notice that says that the Document is released under this
      License.</para>

      <para>The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
      listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that
      says that the Document is released under this License.</para>

      <para>A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable
      copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the
      general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and
      straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
      pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
      drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for
      automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text
      formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose
      markup has been designed to thwart or discourage subsequent modification
      by readers is not Transparent. A copy that is not "Transparent" is
      called "Opaque".</para>

      <para>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
      ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or
      XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML
      designed for human modification. Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF,
      proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word
      processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are
      not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML produced by some
      word processors for output purposes only.</para>

      <para>The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
      plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
      this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats
      which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means the text
      near the most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the
      beginning of the body of the text.</para>

      <para>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either

      copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to
      the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
      conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use
      technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying
      of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept
      compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough
      number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section

      <title>COPYING IN QUANTITY</title>

      <para>If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than
      100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
      enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these
      Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts
      on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
      you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the
      full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible.
      You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with
      changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the
      Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim
      copying in other respects.</para>

      <para>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
      legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
      reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
      pages.</para>

      <para>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
      numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
      Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each
      Opaque copy a publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a
      complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which
      the general network-using public has access to download anonymously at
      no charge using public-standard network protocols. If you use the latter
      option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin
      distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this
      Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location
      until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque
      copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to
      the public.</para>

      <para>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of

          <para>Each Workbench window contains one or more perspectives. A
          perspective defines the initial set and layout of views in the

          same set of editors. Each perspective provides a set of
          functionality aimed at accomplishing a specific type of task or
          works with specific types of resources. For example, the
          <guibutton>Tactical Analysis</guibutton> perspective combines views
          that you would commonly use while editing analysing tactical files,
          while the <guibutton>Contact Ork</guibutton> perspective would help
          aliens (typically named Mork) in contacting their mother planet -
          together with the VOIP software link direct to Orson. As you work in
          the Workbench, you will probably switch perspectives frequently,
          especially if you're having Mindy trouble.</para>

          <para>Perspectives control what appears in certain menus and
