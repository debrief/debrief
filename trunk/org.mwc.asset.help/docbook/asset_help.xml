          <application>ASSET</application> comprises a highly optimised modular modelling engine
          with a number of graphical front-ends tailored to specific approaches in the solution of
          tactical problems. The front-ends used by <application>ASSET</application> allow
          computer-controlled, human-in-the-loop and composite engagements to be investigated by
          scientific and non-scientific users, providing outputs for subsequent After Action Review.

        <para>Not only does <application>ASSET</application> have strong modelling capabilities, it

          investigating two contacts of interest) using recognised NATO symbology. Where the 2
          dimensional view is insufficient then a 3 dimensional dynamic view can be opened. The
          following screenshot shows a friendly helo about to prosecute a hostile submarine, itself
          attempting to prosecute a friendly warship. The 3 dimensional view has a range of options
          to improve legibility. These include magnifying the size of the participants themselves
          (as in the screenshot), configurable grid-lines, ocean shading, and snail trails. <figure>

          <application>ASSET</application> has been built from the ground up to provide tactical
          modelling facilities to support the needs of maritime tactical development. Fundamental to
          this strategy has been the identification of an acceptable fidelity in modelling, where
            <application>ASSET</application> can be used in initial investigations into new tactical
          problems - acknowledging that it may be necessary to employ a higher fidelity model in the
          later stages of analysis, and that frequently the only true test for a tactic is
          real-world employment. Nevertheless, <application>ASSET</application> can be employed to
          great benefit in the following methods of analysis: <itemizedlist>

              <para>
                <emphasis>Quantitative analysis.</emphasis> The direct comparison of different
                tactics allows for sensitivity analysis of different characteristics such as initial
                manoeuvres, evasion headings/speeds and protective screen dispositions. Different
                engagements can be compared through analysis of time-to-detection, closest point of
                approach, number of kills or a wide variety of other user-defined performance
                measures. </para>

            <listitem>
              <para>
                <emphasis>Mission rehearsal.</emphasis> It is no longer necessary to wait for a sea
                trial before progressing an area of tactical development. Trial tactics can be
                synthetically modelled in <application>ASSET</application>, discarding poorly
                performing tactics to concentrate sparse sea-time on optimally performing solutions.
                Additionally, an exercise-order can be rehearsed in-house prior to being sent to sea
                to test for completeness and highlight areas where greater detail is needed or
                remove exercise serials which will clearly not progress the problem under
                investigation. </para>

                environmental conditions, rules of engagement, or sensor performance, leading to a
                greater understanding of exercise events and improving the quality of analysis.

                <application>ASSET</application> provides a quick turnaround, low cost means of
                trialling new ways of conducting joint warfare. Expert users can experiment
                collaboratively to trial new force capabilities, quickly determining strong and weak
                points in command and control structures or platform capabilities. Lessons learnt
                from <application>ASSET</application> can leverage effort invested in sea-trials to
                quickly produce new or improved operational capabilities at short notice. </para>

                can model these equipments and provide performance predictions to allow for early
                recognition of potential advantages or shortcomings possibly years ahead of their
                use at sea. When the equipments are first available for use effort can be

          <title>Modular modelling</title>
          <para>The modular modelling mechanisms contained within ASSET allow the engine to conduct
            modelling at a range of resolutions - all configured dynamically at run-time, not
            build-time. For example, the modular modelling allows the user to elect to model an
            acoustic sensor using cookie-cutter detections or full sonar equations by specifying his
            requirement in the ASSET scenario file. Additionally, varying levels of complexity can
            be combined to suit the analysis problem at hand - the designer getting support from
            informed guidance in the ASSET modelling handbook. </para>
          <para>Despite the wide range of modelling modules in ASSET, they remain "thin" software
            components - that is, they rely to a great extent on the parameters passed to them from
            datafiles. This inherent reliance on datafiles provides a great degree of flexibility to
            the software - and as before, this is determined at run-time by the user not at
            build-time by the developer.</para>

            Centre's <application>Debrief </application>application. Added to these components are
            further modules to handle file read/write, time management, and networking. Assembling
            different combinations of these modules provides a number of applications supporting
            various analysis/tactical development requirements, from non-graphic plain text
            applications (used for monitoring number crunching of large numbers of scenarios), to
            detailed graphic environments aimed to replicate onboard displays (so adding to the
            realism of the simulation whilst reducing the learning curve for understanding the
            results displayed). </para>

          <title>Java programming language</title>
          <para>The last three decades have seen an explosion in the variety and number of
            programming languages and environments available for software development. Sun
            Microsystems took the lessons learnt from previous languages such as Pascal, Fortran and
            c++ and produced the Java programming language. Very quickly after its release Java
            experienced wide industry adoption, and use for development of heavyweight applications.
            The adoption of Java within <application>ASSET</application> provides the following
            benefits: <itemizedlist>
              <listitem>
                <para>
                  <emphasis>Platform Independence</emphasis> Through the use of Java, <application
                    >ASSET</application> is able to run on a wide variety of operating systems, from
                  standard desktop PC's to high performance Linux and Solaris workstations capable
                  of number-crunching vast numbers tactical scenarios. </para>

                <para>
                  <emphasis>Object Orientation.</emphasis> Tactical modelling inherently lends
                  itself to object orientation; the representation of real-world objects as
                  functional software units. For example, the object orientated support provided to
                    <application>ASSET</application> by Java allows a software model of an SSK to
                  quickly be produced taking the existing model of an SSN and adding battery usage,
                  and snorting noise models. This significantly reduces both development and
                  maintenance costs. </para>

                  <emphasis>Rich Standard Library.</emphasis> Java contains an extensive set of
                  standard libraries, which have been exploited in <application>ASSET</application>
                  to provide user interface, network communications, XML file storage, and 3
                  dimensional viewing. Use of standard libraries in addition of these areas of
                  functionality to <application>ASSET</application> has reduced development costs,
                  maintenance costs, and through-life costs (since they will never incur license
                  charges). </para>

                <para>
                  <emphasis>Wide developer support.</emphasis> The adoption of Java by industry,
                  academic and research institutions world-wide significantly eases the problem of
                  finding qualified development support - all recent computer science graduates will
                  have a grounding in Java, and most will be fully competent in using it in
                  developments such as <application>ASSET</application>. Thus an organisation making
                  use of <application>ASSET</application> can be increasingly confident of finding
                  suitably trained developmental effort. </para>

        <para>The <application>ASSET</application> Modelling guide gives details of the elements,

          The modelling guide does not give any detail, nor does it refer to any front-ends through
          which the engine may be accessed. This information is contained in the <link

          <application>ASSET</application> modelling philosophy </title>
        <para>
          <application>ASSET</application> has adopted a specific modelling philosophy which
          directly affects the resolution of modelling performed. The role of <application
            >ASSET</application> is seen as an advanced substitute for graph paper - used to look at
          vessel geometries and detections quickly, reliably and robustly. </para>
        <para>
          <application>ASSET</application> does not aim to approach <emphasis>real-world</emphasis>
          levels of modelling, and there is no expectation of producing results which can replace
          tactical development undertaken at sea. <application>ASSET</application> does, however,
          aim to allow a user to run through a simplified version of the real world to gain a better
          understanding of a particular platform, sensor or tactic. Through the use of <application
            >ASSET</application> it is hoped that the Tactical Development process can be
          accelerated through the discarding of the low-value tactics allowing at-sea exercise time
          to focus on high-value tactics. </para>
        <para>Of course the results produced by <application>ASSET</application> have to be
          relatively realistic, so vessels manoeuvre using specific turning circles and acceleration
          rates, sensors have specific recognition differentials, and energy travelling through the
          environment experiences propagation loss. </para>
        <important>
          <para>The <application>ASSET</application> user should have a full understanding of the
            modelling abstraction used in a specific scenario, <application>ASSET</application> is
            not attempting to reproduce a "real-world" equivalent, and the user must decide what
            assumptions can be made of the results. A thorough understanding of the <application
              >ASSET</application> Modelling Guide is required before any analysis of results is
            conducted. </para>

                    units is experienced. This loss is linearly reduced at smaller ranges - this at
                    half of the maximum line of sight, a loss of 2500 units is experienced, and so
                    on. Thus a sensor will have to be well within the maximum line-of-sight range of
                    a submarine periscope to see it. An offset is applied to this linear
                    relationship to reflect that very small targets (such as the submarine
                    periscope) are in fact visible at several kilometers, not the hundreds of yards
                    as would be calculated. The loss calculated is reduced by 700 to represent this

              a particular speed/depth), some equipment lineup (helo in the dip, or SSN waiting for
              towed array steady), or some command and control state (surface ship at Action
              Stations).</para>
            <para>Examples of varying vessel behaviour depending upon state are: a helo only
              travelling to a new dip when it isn't currently in the dip, a surface ship may not
              undergo replenishment at sea when at Action Stations, and an SSK may undergo a
              particular evasive manoeuvre when detecting an enemy vessel whilst snorting.
              Additionally, the fundamental characteristics of a vessel may change according to that
              vessel state: the recognition differential of a surface ship sensor may decrease
              whilst at Action Stations, the radiated noise levels of an SSK increase whilst
              snorting. <figure id="figure_state_management">

          <title>Detection</title>
          <para>Within the detection step the model steps through each of the sensors on the current
            vessel. After checking whether the sensor is enabled, the model then examines each
            scenario participant to see if it is detectable on the medium detected by that sensor.
            If the vessel is detectable ASSET uses the sensor model to determine if a detection is
            produced. Detections obtained are added to a list, to be passed in turn to the decision
            step.</para>

          <title>Decision</title>
          <para>The decision step passes the current vessel status, demanded vessel status and the
            current list of detections to the high level decision model for the vessel. Typically
            this will be a Waterfall model, but any may be used. The Waterfall model then performs
            its processing, finally returning a demanded status - for use by the movement step in
            the next time cycle.</para>

            <para>The Turn Algorithm is the low-level model which moves a vessel along a course and
              speed, and handles the transition from current course/speed/depth to demanded
              course/speed/depth within that platform's <link linkend="mod_movement">manoevering

            <title>Algorithm</title>
            <para>The algorithm updates a vessel's course/speed/location according to the demanded
              course/speed/depth passed in and that vessel's set of <link linkend="mod_movement"

              demanded status within that platform's constraints. </para>
            <para>Of significance within the algorithm is the decision regarding which of the course
              &amp; speed change will take longer. Processing the first part of the manoeuvre (where
              both course and speed are changing), followed by the second part of the manoeuvre
              (where only one is changing) simplifies the calculation of mean speed (and this
              distance travelled) during each period. The algorithm is implemented as
              follows:</para>

            <title>Modelling guidance</title>
            <para>ASSET users have no direct control over this algorithm - vessel movement is
              controlled via the vessel manoeuvering characteristics. The vehicle dynamics modelled
              within this algorithm are environment-independent, and may be seen to reflect the
              movement of submarines, aircraft or surface vessels. Higher level modelling algorithms
              (such as <link linkend="mod_waypoint_transition">waypoint transition</link>) are used
              to translate demanded location into demanded course and depth - including where
              platforms travel near to but do not actually visit a location. </para>
            <para>The turn algorithm works at most sizes of time interval, though because of an
              smoothing function (when speed delta is less than 0.001 m/sec or course delta is less
              than 0.01 degrees just assume on speed/course) time intervals of the order of several
              milliseconds may not work.</para>

            requires that a participant pass through a particular waypoint and leave that waypoint

          <para>A modified "cookie-cutter" approach is proposed. Each entity will be in one of 4
            states with respect to the sensor - UNDETECTED, DETECTED, CLASSIFIED and IDENTIFIED. </para>
          <para>Each sensor will have a predicted range RP, which will be calculated for each
            combination of sensor and target and depend on (inter alia) target, target aspect,
            weather conditions. In addition each sensor will have a time between detection
            opportunities (TBDO in seconds) and variability in detection range - VDR (between 0 and
            1.0). Every time an RP is generated a random element is applied to produce an
            instantaneous range (RI). For each completed TBDO there will be one possible detection
            opportunity, with the RI compared to the actual range (RA). If RA &lt;= RI then the
            target will be in state DETECTED. Transition to CLASSIFIED will take place when range
            has reduced to a certain percentage of R <emphasis>and</emphasis> the contact has been
            DETECTED for a certain number of seconds - transition to IDENTIFIED will then take place
            in a similar manner. The parameters for these transitions will be specified for each
            sensor. If at any time the contact goes outside a maximum tracking range then it will
            revert to UNDETECTED status. </para>

        <title>Introduction</title>
        <para>Many objects in <application>ASSET</application> possess their own behaviour,
          implemented through a form of artificial intelligence. The provision of behaviours
          prevents the need for a dedicated driver for each vessel, and allows agreed behaviours to
          be distributed throughout an organisation - so that all analysts are trialling tactics
          against the same target for example. </para>
        <para>The behaviour model also allows a particular set of Rules of Engagement (
            <acronym>ROE</acronym>) to be defined for a vessel or group of vessels to give them a
          repeatable behaviour. </para>
        <para>Each behaviour receives the current vessel <glossterm linkend="G_CURRENT_STATE"
            >status</glossterm> (course, speed, depth), the current list of <glossterm
            linkend="G_DETECTION">detections</glossterm>, and a <glossterm
            linkend="G_SCENARIO_MONITOR">scenario activity monitor</glossterm>, returning a
            <glossterm linkend="G_DEMANDED_STATE">demanded status</glossterm> (course/speed). If the
          particular behaviour does currently apply, then a null <glossterm
            linkend="G_DEMANDED_STATE">demanded status</glossterm> is returned. When a participant
          receives a null <glossterm linkend="G_DEMANDED_STATE">demanded status</glossterm> it
          continues travelling on its current course and slows down to it's minimum speed. </para>
        <para>Structural behaviours allow the combination of "real" behaviours - providing a complex
          behaviour pattern without actually making any tactical decision themselves. Structural
          behaviours control how their child behaviours are used/called. Some behaviours (such as
            <link linkend="behaviour_Waterfall">Waterfall</link>) allow the processing of one
          behaviour to be interrupted by a higher priority behaviour. When this happens the
          lower-level behaviour receives a message to inform it that it's processing was
          interrupted. Most behaviours will not make use of this message. Some <link
            linkend="transit_behaviours">transitting</link> and <link linkend="tactical_behaviours"
            >tactical</link> ones do though. The Ladder-Search, for example takes the participant
          back to it's last point on the search track prior to being interrupted. </para>

            <para>Frequently there are occasions when a participant could execute one of a number of
              behaviours. This could be represented within the scenario as definitions of multiple
              vessels - but since all vessel properties (other than the behaviour) are identical
              this incurs a maintenance/configuration cost. Use of the switch allows a single
              participant to be defined, with it's behaviour controlled at run-time. When performing
              Monte Carlo simulation use of the Switch allows the target population to randomly
              employ one of the predetermined behaviours (Aggressive vs Evasive for example).</para>

              direction at current speed and at a rate of turn ROT until course is as demanded.
              Default ROT is 3 degrees per second, but in may vary between 1 and 10 degrees. If the

              friendly &amp; hostile). This condition is used to determine if ownship is in contact

              location and conducting an evasive behaviour. </para>

                  </orderedlist>Although the second method is more accurate (since the first must
                  make approximations regarding the actual speed/state of the vehicle as it reaches
                  each waypoint), it is more computationally expensive and involves a more complex
                  algorithm - so the model is implemented using the first method; if a successive
                  point is more than 2/3 of a turning circle diameter from the previous point (using
                  the vehicle&apos;s speed when entering the search), then that point is not added
                  to the search plan. The following diagrams illustrate this. <xref

            <para>SSKs must return to periscope depth in order to run diesel generators to recharge
              the batteries used for normal propultion. This process is normally known as snorting.
              Snorting represents one of the SSKs critically vulnerable states, it is both
              penetrating the surface and radiating much higher than normal noise levels. A
              consequence of this vulnerability is that the SSK recharge is a behaviour frequently
              modelled in ASW tactical development. The SSK snorting vulnerability can lead to
              complex behaviours. </para>

              produced a scenario using a particular permutation of the user-supplied variances,
              each particular combination of those variances is termed a Case. A case code is used
              to uniquely identify each case. Typically this is performed by generating a line of
              text comprising the name and current value of each variance. Thus the line of text is
              unique to each permutation. The multi-scenario run may contain multiple instances of
              each permutation, but statistics may be generated across those permutations by
              collecting individual scenario performances against their case code. </para>

        <application>ASSET</application> Engine </title>
      <sect1 id="user_engine_intro">
        <title>Introduction</title>
        <para>This chapter will introduce you to some of the terms used in <application
            >ASSET</application> modelling, together with explaining the way in which ASSET is
          capable of generating multiple scenarios and participants based on template information
          you have supplied. </para>
        <para>Essentially the ASSET modelling engine takes a description of the tactical problem, a
          set of instructions regarding how to run through the problem and what information to
          record, and steps forward in time through the scenario until a finish point is reached. It
          is capable of this without the need for a graphical user interface or user interaction of
          any kind, though the software can produce graphical plots of vessel tracks either directly
          (through the TrackPlotObserver) or indirectly (through the use of Debrief
          data-files).</para>
        <sidebar>
          <title>Model Audit</title>
          <para>It is seen as important that ASSET users be able to determine the model build
            configuration of a particular software version. This could be to aid in reproducing a
            prior set of results or for recording tools used in a study report.</para>
          <para>ASSET uses the CVS (Concurrent Version System) version control application to
            implement configuration control of source code, documentation and data-files.
            Consequently a version history is kept of all file changes, including changes to model
            implementations. Inspection of this version history provides an insight into
            implementation changes.</para>
          <para>All of the text-based results outputs of ASSET include a clear reference to the
            ASSET build-date - the date when that instance of the software was automatically built.
            To reproduce a set of results produced using an earlier ASSET build version the source
            code versions from that date can be extracted and a software build performed. </para>
          <para>Further detail regarding ASSET support for Model Audit is contained in the System
            Guide at <xref linkend="sys_version_control"/>. </para>
        </sidebar>
      </sect1>
      <sect1 id="user_design_model">
        <title>Designing a model run</title>
        <para>The modelling problem is represented in two data-files. A scenario file provides a
          record of the scenario to be modelled, and the control file indicates to the modelling
          engine how to run through the scenario, whether multiple pemutations of any entities are
          required, and lastly what non-modelling entities to include (such as an observer which
          records vessel positions to file).</para>
        <sect2>
          <title>Scenario File</title>
          <para>The scenario file provides a textual description of the environment to be modelled,
            and the platforms to model in that environment. It also contains details of the
            start-time, and the desired model time step. </para>
        </sect2>
        <sect2>
          <title>Control File</title>
          <para>The control file provides information to guide ASSET through how the scenario should
            be performed - covering the automatic generation of new participants/scenarios, what
            information to record during the run, and when to stop the run.</para>
          <sect3>
            <title>Auto generation control commands</title>
            <para>The first block of information in a control file is optional, only required when
              the ASSET engine is required to automatically generate a number of targets to be used
              in a <glossterm linkend="G_MONTE_CARLO">Monte Carlo</glossterm> type engagement. </para>
            <para/>
          </sect3>
          <sect3>
            <title>Observers</title>
            <para>The second type of information found in the Control file is the list of scenario
              observers. A scenario observer may act as a read-only entity listening out for a
              particular type of activity within the scenario: such a listener may request that all
              decisions made by a particular platform be recorded to file. Alternatively a scenario
              observer may take on a "referee" responsibility, indicating that the scenario should
              terminate as soon as any red platform makes a valid detection of a particular blue
              platform. Scenario observers are recorded in the <ulink
                url="http://intranet2/coag/asset/api/ASSET/Scenario/Observers/CoreObserver.html"
                >ASSET Source Documentation</ulink>, and how they are recorded in the DTD file is
              recorded in the <ulink url="http://intranet2/coag/asset/help/schemas/ASSET.xsd.html"
                >Schema Documentation</ulink>

        <title>Monte Carlo simulation with ASSET</title>
        <para>When solving a problem using <glossterm linkend="G_MONTE_CARLO">Monte
            Carlo</glossterm> simulation techniques a number of different strategies for use of
          ASSET may be applied, some allow for interactive GUI access, others not. The following
          diagrams illustrate the steps taken: <figure float="0">
            <title>High level Monte Carlo workflow</title>
            <mediaobject>
              <imageobject>
                <imagedata fileref="figures/MonteCarloHighLevelWorkflow.gif"/>
              </imageobject>
            </mediaobject>
          </figure>The analyst first creates a working scenario file (later to be used as template
          for the new permutations). This scenario file can be loaded into Workbench for initial
          testing to verify that participants/entities behave as expected. Next the analyst creates
          the control file which specifies observers to use for the scenario together with scenario
          generator structures which indicate how multiple Monte Carlo instances are to be created. </para>
        <para>The scenario and control files are then processed in either gui or batch mode as shown
          in the following diagram: <figure float="0" id="fig_monte_workflow">
            <title>Monte Carlo simulation workflow</title>

            </mediaobject>
          </figure></para>
        <para>As you can see, the diagram breaks steps down into those undertaken by the operator
          and those undertaken within the modelling engine itself. Significantly, if multi-scenario
          Monte Carlo processing is required then it is not possible to interact with ASSET via a
          gui interface (since we can only see one scenario at a time), though since the control
          files are all written to disk prior to running, it is quite easy to load the scenario
          together with one of the control files and run through a <emphasis>normal</emphasis> ASSET
          run - possibly to investigate particular scenarios in detail after viewing their
          comparative performance. </para>
        <para>The batch-mode approach to Monte Carlo modelling is covered in <xref

          getting the <application>ASSET</application> modelling engine to run through a scenario
          file/command file combination. This section of the User Guide will talk you through

        <title>Getting hold of ASSET</title>
        <note>
          <para>For the first two phases of <application>ASSET</application> development, expert
            users will be receiving and using the software through a more ad-hoc distributions.
            Users download and uncompress a <application>Zip</application>ped archive containing the
            ASSET software, its libraries and any supporting documents (help-files and schemas).
            Until the MWC server re-arrangement is complete the downloadable archive will be stored
            in <filename>nab:\\td submarines info\\asset</filename>. The individual zip files are
            named according to the build date - obviously the newest one is the one to download and
            unzip (probably into a directory such as <filename>c:\asset</filename>). </para>
        </note>
        <para>Right, the first thing you need to do is to get hold of the ASSET software itself,
          from <filename>Applications</filename> folder of the NAB. The software is available in two
          versions, <emphasis>complete</emphasis> and <emphasis>update</emphasis> - depending upon
          whether you want a complete fresh installation or just to download the changed files. If
          you don&apos;t already have <application>ASSET</application> installed on your machine,
          double-click on the <emphasis>install.exe</emphasis> file, and <application
            >ASSET</application> will be installed by default into your <filename>c:\program
            files\ASSET</filename> folder. If you do already have ASSET installed just download the
          newest update zip from the <filename>updates</filename> folder - and extract the files
          into the relevant places. </para>
      </sect1>
      <sect1 id="command_line_preparing">
        <title>Preparing to run ASSET</title>
        <para>So, presuming you have successfully obtained and installed ASSET, we are ready to
          start.</para>
        <para>In order to perform an <application>ASSET</application> simulation, you need to give
          it a synthetic environment to work with, and tell it what you want doing with that
          environment. For the purposes of this tutorial we are going to create simple versions of
          the two files necessary for a command-line ASSET run: the control file and the scenario
          file. The instructions lead you through creating the files using the <application>
            <glossterm linkend="G_XMLSPY">XMLSpy</glossterm>
          </application> editor, though any other data-oriented XML editor will do. </para>
        <sect2 id="tutorial_create_scenario">
          <title>Creating a scenario file</title>
          <para>Right, we&apos;re going to break down creating the scenario file into two stages:
            first we define how the whole scenario behaves (the top-level guidance) then we define
            the participants themselves.</para>
          <sect3>
            <title>Top-level guidance</title>
            <para>The scenario file is the meatier of the two files, containing a description of
              both the environment we will be working within and the participants which it contains.
              So, first you need to open up XMLSpy - which will give you a display like that shown
              below: <figure float="0">
                <title>XMLSpy opening screenshot</title>

                </mediaobject>
              </figure>As you can see, there are all sorts of files which can be created, but
              we&apos;re just going to create a plain old XML data-file - so double-click on
                <guilabel>xml XML Document</guilabel>. The next dialog shown will ask you if you
              want to assign a DTD or Schema for the data-file. It&apos;s the Schema which specifies
              the structure and form of the scenario file, so yes, we certainly do want to specify a
              Schema - make sure Schema is selected, and press <guibutton>OK</guibutton>. From the
              file-selector dialog which appears next, click on the <guibutton>Browse</guibutton>
              button, navigate to your <application>ASSET</application> installation directory and
              select <filename>ASSET.XSD</filename>. You will now be invited to select the
              root-element, which dictates what type of file you are going to define. Select
                <computeroutput>Scenario</computeroutput>. </para>

            <tip>
              <para>Now, in your view, you may not have the 3 information windows visible on the
                right-hand side (Elements, Attributes and Entities). They really help in the
                creation of a scenario, so make them visible by selecting <guimenuitem>Entry
                  Helpers</guimenuitem> from the <guimenu>Window</guimenu> menu. </para>
            </tip>
            <para>So, as we look at the data visible in the XMLSpy window we can see three sets of
              information: the XML identifier (which is always present and doesn&apos;t relate to
              our use of XMLSpy), the DOCTYPE specifier of scenario (which tells XMLSpy what we want
              to build, and what it&apos;s made up from, and lastly the scenario itself. Currently
              the Scenario is empty - it has the preconfigured but unused box titled ,
                <computeroutput>Name</computeroutput>. Let&apos;s fill them in to get started. First
              type in a <computeroutput>Name</computeroutput> for the scenario; <computeroutput
                >first scenario</computeroutput> should do for this time. With the cursor in the
                <computeroutput>Name</computeroutput> box you, if you look at the <guilabel
                >Append</guilabel> tab of the <guilabel>Attributes</guilabel> toolbox on the
              right-hand side of <application>XMLSpy</application> you will see a list of optional
              Scenario attributes. On of these is <computeroutput>StartTime</computeroutput>. If you
              single-click on the start-time attribute to select it, the <guilabel>Info</guilabel>
              window will update to show guidance related to the start-time attribute. Next,
              double-click on the <computeroutput>StartTime</computeroutput> attribute in the list,
              and <application>XMLSpy</application> will add it to the scenario. Into the Start Time
              box type today's date in the form <computeroutput>yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss</computeroutput>
              (such as 2003-01-24T13:00:03). As you select the are typing into the <computeroutput
                >StartTime</computeroutput> box, notice this also provides explanatory information
              Info window. This explanatory information is available for most of the available
              information types. Also insert a <computeroutput>Created</computeroutput> item, again
              giving it today's date. Moving down through the list of core scenario information, the
                <computeroutput>Step Time</computeroutput> box represents the amount of scenario
              time we move forward at each step. First click on the down arrow next to
                <computeroutput>StepTime</computeroutput> to make it&apos;s attributes editable. Now
              double-click to the right of the <computeroutput>Units</computeroutput> attribute and
              select minutes from the drop-down list. Lastly enter the figure 1 as the
                <computeroutput>value</computeroutput>. This will instruct <application
                >ASSET</application> to move the scenario forward 1 minute at each model step.

        <para>In Autumn 2003 Jon Walters derived an improved above-water sensor model for use in
          ASSET. Significantly, this algorithm modelled the transition of a target from undetected

          model.</para>

        <para>The scenario we plan to model is that of a helicopter investigating a series of

          on radar, but since the radar sensor is typically unable to identify a target the helo
          closes to visual range to actually identify the target. Once the fishing vessel is
          identified as not being the target of interest the helo continues it&apos;s search
          path.</para>

        <para>In the spirit of having a go at sticking all sorts of data into the scenario we will

          in a similar way to the <guilabel>TargetAspectSet</guilabel>, entering lists of values
          indexed against participant type. <application>ASSET</application> only requires data
          values for sea state one to six, if your scenario requires data in higher sea states they

        <para>Now that the radar is in there we'll move onto the visual environment lookup table.
          The routine here is similar to that for radar. Two of the four sub-tables store
          vessel-type related data similar those we've just entered, with the other two being simple
          lists. The vessel-related tables take optional <guilabel>UnknownType</guilabel> attributes
          as covered earlier. Lastly insert a <guilabel>MADLookupEnvironment</guilabel> - providing
          sample values for the four participant types covered earlier. As a helping hand, here is

        <para>Lastly we must set the behaviour of the helo - until we have detection state-aware

            </listitem>
          </orderedlist></para>
        <para>So, we'll start off by talking through the problem and the analysis requirement then
          skim through creating the scenario/control files. You won't need a lot of guidance in
          creating the data files after all of the previous experience in this tutorial.</para>
      </sect1>
      <sect1 id="force_prot_define">
        <title>Define the problem</title>
        <para>The problem being addressed in this use of <application>ASSET</application> is that of
          a Merlin HM Mk1 performing force protection duties around ships of a task force. The helo
          conducts visual identification (without an EO device) of small vessels considered a
          potential threat to the force. In addition to analysing the search and identification task
          undertaken by the helo this scenario will additionally consider the effects of an unknown
          small vessel carrying a surface-to-air missile (SAM) with hostile intentions against the
          helo. We will need to consider the following: <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para>Is the likelihood of the helo being shot down related to the time of day, sea
                state, or atmospheric conditions?</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
              <para>On average, for a given set of environmental conditions what proportion of the
                set of small vessels will be identified before the helo comes under fire from the
                hostile participant. </para>
            </listitem>
          </itemizedlist></para>
        <para>So we will perform multiple runs through a scenario containing a blue helo, multiple
          green fishing vessels and a single red fishing vessel. If the helo enters SAM range of the
          fishing vessel whilst in sight of the fishing vessel we will assume an attack happens and
          halt the scenario at that point ( <xref linkend="obs_proximity_detection_observer"/>).
          Otherwise each scenario will run for one hour ( <xref linkend="obs_time_observer"/> ). For
          each scenario we may want a track plot ( <xref linkend="obs_track_plot"/>), and Debrief
          replay files ( <xref linkend="mod_DebriefReplayObserver"/>).We will also want to keep a
          record of how many fishing vessels were successfully identified ( <xref

        <title>Create the control file</title>
        <para>The control file is more challenging for this scenario than previous ones, we&apos;ve
          a fairly complex sensitivity analysis to support, together with producing a
          wider-than-previous range of participants. Its production is broken down into the three
          parts handling generating the <link linkend="multi_scen_gen">multiple scenarios</link>,
          generating the <link linkend="multi_part_gen">multiple random fishing vessels</link>
          within each scenario, and specifying the <link linkend="mod_observers">observers</link>
          which will control and observe the running scenarios. </para>
        <sect2>
          <title>Multi Scenario Generator</title>
          <para>The multi-scenario generator is configured to produce the required number of
            scenarios, with an indicated maximum number of permutations of each scenario <link
              linkend="G_VARIANCE">variance</link>. This max number of permutations is roughly
            calculated as the number of scenario runs requested divided by the product of the number
            of permutations allowed by the variances. After this header information the set of
            variances themselves are recorded. According to the analyst&apos;s problem statement
            there are variances to be defined: for atmospheric attenuation, sea state and light
            level. Each of these is implemented as a Choice variance where we supply a list of
            optional values to choose; though note that the Range variance could have been used for
            the sea-state variable. </para>
        </sect2>
        <sect2>
          <title>Multi Participant Generator</title>
          <para>The multi-participant generator is used to both give some randomness to the fishing
            vessel start positions and to create the series of fishing vessels representing the
            dense fishing area. First we will define the participant variance for the SAM-carrying
            fisherman. We provide the name of the scenario-file participant we are going to vary (
              <computeroutput>SAM_FISHER</computeroutput> in this case), and then indicate how many
            permutations of this participant are required (1). We then vary the initial location,
            course and speed. Next we specify the participant variance for the non-SAM carrying
            fishing vessel. Again we name the scenario participant we are varying ( <computeroutput
              >SAM_FISHER</computeroutput>), and indicate how many permutations we require (49 to
            make a total number of 50 fishing vessels). Again we cary the initial location, course
            and speed. </para>
        </sect2>
        <sect2>
          <title>Observers</title>
          <para>Lastly we specify the observers for the scenario, comprising <link
              linkend="tut_fp_cont_obs">controlling</link> observers and <link
              linkend="tut_fp_recording_obs">recording</link> observers. </para>
          <sect3 id="tut_fp_cont_obs">
            <title>Controlling Observers</title>
            <para>These observers stop the scenario when a particular condition occurs. The two stop
              conditions for this analysis are the time limit (see <xref linkend="obs_time_observer"
              />) and the aircraft being shot down. We model the aircraft being shot down through
              stopping the scenario when the SAM-carrying fishing vessel is in visual contact with
              the helo and within weapons range (see <xref
                linkend="obs_proximity_detection_observer"/>). </para>
          </sect3>
          <sect3 id="tut_fp_recording_obs">
            <title>Recording Observers</title>
            <para>There are two thrusts to recording the output of this scenario analysis: to obtain
              an understanding of the whole batch of runs, and to be able to drill-down into the
              detail of particular runs. Working in reverse order, we retain individual run results
              by specifying either an observer producing a <link linkend="mod_DebriefReplayObserver"
                >track file</link> in <application>Debrief</application> replay format or one
              producing a <link linkend="obs_track_plot">single graphic image</link>. </para>
            <para>The batch recorders used for this analysis are specified such that the analysis
              Measures of Effectiveness ( <emphasis>whether the aircraft was shot down</emphasis>,
              and <emphasis>how many targets were identified</emphasis>) may be supported. The <link
                linkend="obs_final_state">Final State observer</link> is configured to record
              per-case results summarised as a <link linkend="obs_batch_collation">frequency
                list</link> - indicating to us how many scenarios of each permutation ended with
              helo-splashing versus time out. Secondly we use a <link
                linkend="obs_detection_observer">Detection Observer</link> configured to record how
              many fishing vessels were <link linkend="lookup_definitions">identified</link> by the
              helo. Per case processing is switched on again, so that our output results are matched
              against the variables of interest. </para>
            <para>The final control file is supplied below. <example>

          <para>The <application>Workbench</application> should currently be showing a zoomed in
            portion of the total tactical area, possibly with one or more scales or grids added from
            the previous step. If you're not looking at a view like this, just perform a <link
              linkend="FIT_TO_WIN_BUTTON">Fit to Window</link>, then zoom in to cover around 25% of
            the tactical area ensuring that you have included our Blue searcher. Hover the mouse
            over the blue helo and a tooltip will appear detailing the name of the participant, its
            current hierarchy of behaviours and current status. In the sample scenario loaded for
            the tutorial the tooltip text was: <computeroutput>HELO_ALPHA:Go and do a couple of
              dips:First ladder search:Performing ladder search:Heading for Point:2 21 degs 72 m_sec
              152m</computeroutput>. As you hover the mouse around the plot you will see the tooltip
            update to reflect the status of the nearest participant. If you right-click on an empty
            region of sea a popup-menu will appear. This menu contains options and commands used to
            change the format/presentation of the plot - attributes not directly related to any
            scenario participants. Alternatively, if you right-click on one of the participants then
            you will see the general commands at the bottom of the menu together with any specific
            to the current participant at the top (as shown below). The general trend of the popup
            menu is that each editable item has an entry titled "Edit <emphasis>xxx</emphasis>"
            which will open the property editor for that window, followed by a cascaded child menu
            containing directly editable attributes of that item. In the screenshot below we can see
            that the <emphasis>ShowContact</emphasis> attribute of <guilabel>HELO_ALPHA</guilabel>

            up that group and allow you to set the child items on/off or double-click to edit them.
            Of significance to this example the <guilabel>Scenario</guilabel> group contains 51
            items (participants). Right-clicking on the <guilabel>Scenario</guilabel> group provides
            access to the Scenario formatting options. Open the cascading menu titled <guilabel>Edit
              Scenario</guilabel>and clear the tick box labelled <guilabel>Show Activity</guilabel>.
            At last all of the vessel activity labels have dissappeared. </para>
          <para>Back to the Layer Manager, opening the <guilabel>Scenario</guilabel> group will show
            all of the participants listed by name. In the example scenario loaded the blue helo

        <para>The example scenarios presented so far largely focus on helicopter based tactics -
          with interactions dominated by detections from above-water sensors. This section of the
          tutorial will switch to the other significant area of detection modelling within
            <application>ASSET</application>, focussing on <link linkend="mod_detection">underwater
            acoustic sensors</link>. </para>
        <para>The tactical problem to be considered entails an SSN performing a series of movements
          and active sonar transmissions (as shown in the diagram <link linkend="SubSearchDiag"
            >below</link>) with the intention of influencing an opposing force SSK. Airborne
          participants will provide radar coverage, though this will be modelled at a level above
          the MPAs themselves; through a detection performance observer. </para>
        <para> The analysis of the problem will include variation in the SSN's prescripted search
          plan and the behaviour (aggressive vs evasive) of the SSK. We will start off by performing
          a series of <link linkend="user_command_line_monte">command-line Monte Carlo</link>
          simulations to work through a large number of permutations, then further investigate
          scenarios of interest using the <link linkend="userguide_workbench">Workbench</link> GUI
          environment. </para>
        <para>Since the SSN in this scenario is not responsive to the SSKs, we are able to use <link
            linkend="parallel_planes">parallel planes</link> processing - our scenario will contain
          the single blue searcher but many red ssks all operating in <link
            linkend="parallel_planes">parallel planes</link> unaware of each other. This will both
          bring performance advantages, and allow the multiple SSK permutations to be monitored

            environmental tables used for lookup sensors are not required here - no lookup sensors
            are required for the scenario). I suggest a low sea-state and relatively clear

          <sect3>
            <title>SSK</title>
            <para>Next come with the participants, starting with the SSK. Give it a name
              (obviously), something like <emphasis>Target</emphasis> should do. Next comes its
                <link linkend="RECHARGE_NOTE">charge rate</link>, I found <computeroutput
                >0.005</computeroutput> gave realistic enough results. Lastly indicate that the SSK
              is a Monte Carlo Target - to receive special <link linkend="parallel_planes">parallel
                planes</link> processing. Then comes the <guilabel>Category</guilabel>, which will
              indicated that this a <computeroutput>SUBSURFACE, RED, SUBMARINE</computeroutput>. </para>
            <para>The sensor fit represents the next data to record, for our example we'll equip the
              SSK with <guilabel>Broadband Sensor</guilabel> and <guilabel>Active
                Intercept</guilabel> sensors (giving the broadband sensor an aperture of 130
              degrees). For the initial status of the ssk place it using a <guilabel>Relative
                Location</guilabel> at (0nm,0nm,-60m), with a course of 0, fuel level of 100, and
              speed of 10 kts. Before we take on the compex task of defining the SSK behaviour we'll
              finish off the simpler components. So, give the SSK a <guilabel
                >RadiatedCharacteristics</guilabel> item, and insert <guilabel
                >SSKBroadband</guilabel>
              <link linkend="mod_acoustic_rad">radiated noise</link> dataset. Specify a Base Noise
              Level of 70, and a Snort Noise Level of 120. </para>
            <sidebar>
              <para>As a reminder, the SSK has two broadband <link linkend="mod_acoustic_rad"
                  >radiated noise</link> levels: a quiet one for when running deep on main motor
                (battery-powered) and a noisier one for when snorting at periscope depth. </para>
            </sidebar>
            <para>Lastly indicate the submarine's movement characteristics, using the <guilabel
                >SSMovementCharacteristics</guilabel> structure. I used the following values: </para>
            <para>
              <programlisting>

                &lt;MaxSpeed Units="kts" Value="12"/&gt;
                &lt;AccelerationRate Units="kt/s" Value="1"/&gt;
                &lt;DecelerationRate Units="kt/s" Value="1"/&gt;

                &lt;TurningCircle Units="m" Value="600"/&gt;
                &lt;/SSMovementCharacteristics&gt;
              </programlisting>
            </para>
            <para>The last item to be entered for the SSK is its behaviour. In support of our
              analysis objectives we're going to supply the SSK with two alternate behaviours. Our
              Monte Carlo processing can then provide target instances demonstrating either an
              Aggressive or Evasive posture. The two high level behaviours are contained in a <link
                linkend="behaviour_switch">Switch</link> container. So, start off by inserting a
                <link linkend="behaviour_switch">Switch</link> object immediately below the SSK
              status. Give the switch a name, and indicate the detault behaviour to be executed (
                <computeroutput>1</computeroutput> will do). Each of the two behaviours will be
              contained in a <link linkend="behaviour_Waterfall">Waterfall</link> structure. We'll
              start off with the Evasive behaviour. So insert the Waterfall structure, and give it a
              name of something like <computeroutput>Evasive</computeroutput>. Into the Waterfall we
              will insert the hierarchical SSK evade behaviour, starting with the highest priority.
              In this instance we will make the SSK maintaining it's batteries at a safe level the
              highest priority behaviour, so insert <guilabel>SSKRecharge</guilabel> fom from
                <guilabel>Elements</guilabel> tab. Name it as <computeroutput>Emergency
                Snort</computeroutput>, set the minimum level as 5 and the safe level as 15, and
              indicate that the SSK will snort at a speed of 4 knots. </para>
            <para>So, when the SSK battery level reaches dangerously low levels it will conduct a
              snort however hostile its current environment may be. Obviously it won't conduct a
              very long snort - just enought to keep the SSK operational.</para>
            <para>The next component of the SSK evasive behaviour will cover the evasion itself.
              Beneatch the <guilabel>SSK Recharge</guilabel> component insert an <guilabel
                >Evade</guilabel> component, naming it <computeroutput>Avoid SSN</computeroutput>.
              Configure this behaviour to continue evading for a period of 30 minutes, at a depth of
              80m (that's a height of -80m by the way), and at a speed of 6 knots. Lastly, indicate
              that the SSK will be evading all <computeroutput>Blue</computeroutput> targets. To
              specify Blue force participants as targets, put the cursor into the <guilabel
                >TargetType</guilabel> element, and double-click <guilabel>Type</guilabel> from the
                <guilabel>Add child</guilabel> tab of the <guilabel>Elements</guilabel> toolbox.
              Within the <guilabel>Type</guilabel> element select <computeroutput
                >BLUE</computeroutput> from the drop-down list. </para>
            <para>Beneath the <computeroutput>Evade</computeroutput> behaviour insert another
                <computeroutput>SSK Recharge</computeroutput> behaviour, to represent normal snort
              behaviour. This snort behaviour will be conducted whenever the battery level falls
              below 30%, on which the SSK will attempt to snort back up to 100%, though not when in
              contact with any blue targets. Set the <computeroutput>EvadeThese</computeroutput>
              type to <computeroutput>BLUE</computeroutput> as you did with the <computeroutput
                >Evade</computeroutput> behaviour above. </para>
            <para>The lowest-level component of the Evasive SSK behaviour is the general patrol
              behaviour. This is represented through a <link linkend="mod_rectangle_wander"
                >Rectangle Wander</link> element, inserted from the <guilabel>Add child</guilabel>
              tab of the <guilabel>Elements</guilabel> toolbox, giving a sensible name, a speed of 6
              knots, and a height of -80m (representing a depth of 80m). By default the top left and
              bottom right corners are specified using Short-Location elements (which take lat and
              long expressed as decimal degrees) . We will be specifying them using
              Relative-Location elements, whcih express the location as ranges from the origin.
              Start to replace the existing elements by selecting the first <computeroutput
                >shortLocation</computeroutput>, then double-click on <computeroutput
                >relativeLocation</computeroutput> from the <guilabel>Insert</guilabel> tab of the
                <guilabel>elements</guilabel> toolbar. Now you can delete the existing
                <computeroutput>shortLocation</computeroutput> item. And repeat this process for the
              other 3 corner references (no, it isn't as long-whinded in real-life as when written
              down). Set the top-left coordinates to 60nm North, 0nm East, and bottom-right to 0nm
              North, 120Nm West. And that's the SSK evasive behaviour complete. </para>
            <para>Next comes the SSK aggressive behaviour. Now, my definition of this behaviour is
              very similar to the evasive behaviour. So start off by making a duplicate of the
              previous <computeroutput>Evasive</computeroutput> Waterfall component, renaming it to
                <computeroutput>Aggressive</computeroutput>. Within this component both of the
                <computeroutput>SSK Recharge</computeroutput> and the <computeroutput>Rectangle
                Wander</computeroutput> behaviours remain unchanged, but we will exchange the
                <computeroutput>Evade</computeroutput> behaviour for an <computeroutput
                >Intercept</computeroutput> one. Delete the <computeroutput>Evade</computeroutput>
              behaviour first, then insert an <computeroutput>Intercept</computeroutput> behaviour
              from the <guilabel>Insert</guilabel> tab of the <guilabel>Elements</guilabel> toolbox.
              Configure the Intercept behaviour to allow speed changes and specify that the SSK will
              attempt to intercept Blue submarines <footnote>
                <para>Sharp-eyed techno-geek readers will have noticed that we could have
                  represented these two behaviours complete. We could have created a single SSK
                  behaviour containing the two recharge and single rectangle wander elements, with
                  the <link linkend="behaviour_switch">Switch</link> between the two recharges. This
                  Switch could then have contained the two alternate Evade and <link
                    linkend="intercept_behaviour">Intercept</link> behaviours. Whilst this structure
                  would represent our two behaviours in a more compact form, it could ultimately
                  hinder the amount of changes which could be made between the two - having two
                  completely separate behaviour waterfalls provides the greatest room for changes.
                </para>
              </footnote>. And that is the SSK complete. </para>
            <para>Next comes the SSN. Start off by giving it a category of <computeroutput>Blue,
                Subsurface, Submarine</computeroutput>. Then provide it with a sensor-fit comprising
                <computeroutput>Active Broadband Sensor</computeroutput> (source level:148,
              aperture:130, working: false <footnote>
                <para>we are setting the working attribute to false to indicate that the sonar isn't
                  transmitting at the start of the scenario - other elements of the SSN behaviour
                  set working to true to indicate that the sensor is transmitting on active.</para>
              </footnote>). Also provide a standard <link linkend="mod_medium_bb">Broadband</link>
              Sensor (aperture:130), and <link linkend="mod_medium_nb">Narrowband</link> sensor
              (steady time 10 minutes). For the SSN initial status give it a full fuel load <footnote>
                <para>yes, fuel level is irrelevant for an SSN in ASSET, it is provided for
                  completeness</para>
              </footnote>, and indicate that it is heading North at 10 knots. Make it's initial
              location 1/2 Nm North &amp; East of the origin, at a depth of 60m (using a
                <computeroutput>relativeLocation</computeroutput>). </para>
            <para>And now on to the SSN behaviour. Insert a <computeroutput
                >Waterfall</computeroutput> element beneath the existing status element, naming it
              something like <computeroutput>SSN Search</computeroutput>. The first item in the ssn
              search is a <link linkend="mod_working_transit">Working Transit</link>, which allows a
              participant to conduct a transit whilst making regular stops to perform a particular
              activity. So, insert the <computeroutput>Working Transit</computeroutput> behaviour
              into the SSN's parent <computeroutput>Waterfall</computeroutput> behaviour,
              configuring it with a name ("sweeping active transit"), number of stops to make (8),
              indicate that the SSN should not repeat the transit on completion (Looping:false), and
              to transit at 12 knots. Define the path to travel through as passing through the
              following sets of coordinates expressed as relative locations in North, East nautical
              miles: (0,0) (30,10) (50,25) (55,40). Into the Working Transit insert the following
              behaviour (activity) performed at 8 points during the transit: <figure float="0"

              passive search area, so insert a <link linkend="mod_wander">Wander</link> behaviour
              representing the passive search. Configure the Wander behaviour with a range of 20
              nautical miles, centre the behaviour on the relative location 15nm North, 40Nm East,
              at a depth of 100m and speed of 12 knots. Next for the SSN comes it's definition of
              radiated noise - set the broadband base noise level to be 70 decibels. Finally
              configure the SSN movement parameters, as shown below:
              <programlisting>&lt;SSMovementCharacteristics FuelUsageRate="0" Name="SSN Movement"&gt;

              And that's the end of the SSN definition, now onto the MPS definition. </para>
            <para>Start off by inserting a <computeroutput>Fixed Wing</computeroutput> participant

            <para>Then go on to set the initial status of the MPA; full fuel tanks, located at a
              position 30nm North, 90nm east, travelling on 060 degrees at 90 knots. The MPA
              behaviour model is quite simple for this scenario, performing a rectangle wander

        <para>Start off by creating the empty control file, as we did <link

            <filename>c:\asset\sm_output</filename> Insert your scenario generator, inserting a
            <computeroutput>MultiScenarioGenerator</computeroutput> into it. Within the
          multi-scenario generator set the <link linkend="ScenarioNameTemplate">name template</link>
          to something useful like <computeroutput>sm_search</computeroutput>, which will become the
          prefix for the automatically generated scenarios. Also set the <link
            linkend="ScenarioNumber">number</link> of scenarios to be generated - start off with
            <computeroutput>10</computeroutput> for now. Also into the Multi Scenario Generator
          element we have to specify what we want <application>ASSET</application> to vary. For this
          tactical problem we will experiment with how frequently the searching SSN conducts active
          transmissions during the sweeping curve, by varying the number of stops on the <link

          into Multi-scenario generator variances list. The list may have sample elements already,
          just ditch them if there are. Now configure this variance to indicate that it is the

          generated, and that the <link linkend="mod_part_name">participant name</link> begin with
            <computeroutput>TGT</computeroutput>. Note that we don't have to set the <computeroutput

            <computeroutput>MonteCarloTarget = true</computeroutput>) for the SSK in the scenario
          file. We do, however, have to specify the variances to apply to the multiple SSKs. This is
          a two-stage process, first setting the general attributes to vary, and then specifying
          where ASSET should place the SSKs. The first variance to insert will vary the speed at
          which the SSK patrols - so the name is <computeroutput>SSK_Speed</computeroutput>, the id
          is <computeroutput>/RectangleWander/Speed</computeroutput>
          <footnote>

            <computeroutput>0.5</computeroutput> knot steps. Next we are going to vary the initial
          course. So, add a new variance called <computeroutput>SSK_Course</computeroutput>, and
          give it the simple <guilabel>id</guilabel> of <computeroutput>Status</computeroutput>.
          Indicate that the we are going to vary the value of the <guilabel>Attribute</guilabel>

        <para>The next item to vary is more significant to our particular analysis, varying the
          posture of the SSK. As you no doubt remember we stored the two mutually exclusive SSK
          behaviours in a <link linkend="behaviour_switch">Switch</link> construct. The Switch
          construct contained the index of which behaviour to activate. We are going to use a
          variance to randomly select one of these behaviours. So, insert a new <guilabel
            >Variance</guilabel> item titled <computeroutput>SSK Posture</computeroutput> with an
          XPath id of <computeroutput>Switch</computeroutput>. Next indicate that we are going to
          vary an <guilabel>Attribute</guilabel> through a <computeroutput>
            <link linkend="mod_gen_choice">Choice</link>
          </computeroutput> of values: <computeroutput>1</computeroutput> and <computeroutput
            >2</computeroutput>. </para>
        <para>Lastly we will define the area through which we want our series of SSKs to be placed.
          This is through use of a <link linkend="mod_gen_dist">ParticipantLocation</link>
          construct. Into this we define a <guilabel>WorldArea</guilabel> comprising top-left and
          bottom-right corners. The top-left (expressed in relative distances: <computeroutput
            >relativeLocation</computeroutput>) us at 60Nm North, 0Nm East and the bottom-right is
          at 0Nm North and 120Nm East. </para>
        <para>After the scenario generation instructions we move on to the <guilabel
            >ObserverList</guilabel>, which indicates which <link linkend="mod_referees"
            >referees</link>and <link linkend="mod_observers">observers</link> we want to monitor
          the running scenario. The observers we will use will record tracks to file for us, and
          stop the scenario after a set period. The first track recorder will be the <link
            linkend="obs_track_plot">Track Plot Observer</link>, used to give us a graphic plot of
          the tracks on completion. Configure the track plot observer to be <computeroutput
            >Active</computeroutput>, to show positions, give it a sensible filename, and ask for a
          grid to be placed over the image on completion (10Nm would seem about right for our
          scenario size). Also specify that <computeroutput>only_final_positions</computeroutput>
          should be provided (to avoid receiving a dense mass of target tracks). Next comes an
          observer used to create Debrief files covering the period: <link
            linkend="mod_DebriefReplayObserver">Debrief Replay Observer</link>. Indicate that you
          want this to record decisions and positions, but not detections - just to keep the volume
          of information down. </para>
        <para>To prevent the scenario from running on ad infinitum add a <link
            linkend="obs_time_observer">Time Observer</link>, configured to stop the scenario after
          36 hours. And that completes the control file. </para>

            status to update, then examine what the SSK is currently doing (the line of text at the
            top of the panel). Due to the names we supplied for the behaviours this should contain a
            clue about whether this is an evasive or aggressive target. Now run the scenario forward
            on automatic and when the SSN starts it's all-sector active transmissions (when you see

          <para>Inheritance is used extensively within the ASSET suite, reducing development times
            and maintenance costs. Common functionality is moved as far "up" the inheritance tree as
            possible, both at initial design and during refactoring in subsequent code changes. An
            example of this inheritance is the ASSET Workbench, which draws first on non-workbench
            related Java Swing components and then on non-Swing related components (see <xref

        <title>Introduction</title>
        <para>This section covers the component of ASSET used for generating new permutations of an
          existing scenario. Monte Carlo simulation techniques are used to investigate the
          probability of a particular outcome by evaluation of multiple permutations of one or more
          characteristics across multiple scenarios ( <link linkend="multi_scen_gen">multiple
            scenario generation.</link>) together with multiple permutations of a scenario
          participants within one scenario ( <link linkend="multi_part_gen">multiple participant

        <para> One, or both of the generation mechanisms may be usefully employed in Monte Carlo

        <title>Multiple participant generation</title>
        <para>The use of multiple instances of a particular participant in a scenario effectively
          allows many scenario permutations to be performed at once - provided the required scenario
          changes are limited to one or more participants of one force.Running through these

          <para>Conventional use of ASSET to analyse the effects of varying a set of scenario
            characteristics requires many model runs. Some of these problems may, however
            alternately be expressed in such a way that ASSET is able to combine many unique
            scenario instances into a single run - typically where the participants of one force
            conduct their behaiour irrespective of the actions of the other force. </para>
          <para>For example, we may have a problem where we wish to investigate varying the search
            speed of a searching participant, aiming to optimise the chances of a detecting a single
            target on a fixed route (commercial shipping route). We can generate a scenario
            containing many instances of the searching asset, each containing a different search
            speed, together with a single target. When running through this scenario we can analyse
            the comparative performance of the many searchers - all from a single model run. The
              <link linkend="parallel_planes_layout">screenshot below</link> illustrates this.
            Assume that the red participant (bottom left) is the hostile vessel following a
            commercial shipping route, and that the blue participants represent a search participant
            starting the search from a range of start locations. We can run the scenario forward,
            monitoring for how many of the blue searchers detect the red vessel. The start points
            which do (or don't) result in a target detection can then be subsequently analysed in
            greater depth. Here parallel planes processing has given an overview result of many
            scenario permutations in a single run. <figure id="parallel_planes_layout">

          <para>As explained earlier, this model use does rely on one one force acting as a
            "clockwork-mouse", acting completely irrespective of the other. Not many scenarios are
            able to represented in a way which meets this constraint, but the parallel planes
            processing certainly offers a worthwhile shortcut to those that do.</para>

        <title>Multiple scenario generation</title>
        <para>Where the <emphasis>multiple participant generation</emphasis> trick isn&apos;t
          sufficient, we have to resort to creating complete new permutations of our scenario of
          interest. Each new scenario permutation is given a unique name (either through sequential
          numbering or by appending details of the specific <link linkend="G_VARIANCE"

        <para>Normally the new scenario permutations are written to disk prior to ASSET working its

          even loaded directly into the <link linkend="user_workbench">Workbench</link> for detailed
          analysis. </para>

          <title>Inter-scenario observers</title>
          <para>Normal scenario observers are created afresh for each scenario run, recording
            details of events during that scenario. Inter-scenario observers track results across a
            series of runs, however, and keep their output file open between runs. Their processing
            is as shown in the figures below:</para>

            <para>The <link linkend="G_CASE_CODE">case code</link> is a significant component within
              inter-scenario observer processing. This code is unique to each permutation of <link

                linkend="monte_inter_scenario">Inter-scenario observer</link> may gather statistics
              either using the unique scenario name, or against the case-code for that scenario,
              outputting the collated statistics on batch completion. </para>

          <para>An example of an Inter-scenario observer is the <guilabel
              >DetectionAchievedObserver</guilabel>, which monitors whether a particular target type
            is detected by a particular host type, maintaining a log which indicates
              <emphasis>true</emphasis> or <emphasis>false</emphasis> for all scenarios within the
            multi-scenario run. </para>

      <title>Code Conventions</title>
      <para>The ASSET software uses mostly standard coding conventions similar to most of those
        available on the Internet: focussing on self-documentiation and ease of readability through
        liberal use of white-space.</para>
      <sect1 id="sys_version_control">
        <title>Version Control</title>
        <para>Version history information is included at the top of ASSET source files through use
          of a CVS template in the javadoc. This version history records the name of the last author
          and the date last checked-in.</para>
        <para>In addition to this, source code files which contain tactical models (such as those
          recorded in the modelling guide) implement the MWCModel interface - and it&apos;s
          getVersion() method. The body of this method contains a quoted CVS macro which will always
          store the date last checked-in, and the javadoc comment contains a complete history of
          check-in comments- providing an insight into how that module has changed. <figure>
