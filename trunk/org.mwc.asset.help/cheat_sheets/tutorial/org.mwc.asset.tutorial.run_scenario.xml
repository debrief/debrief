         Right, we&apos;ve defined the inputs to the simulation.  Now to run them.

         title="Open Scenario Controller.">
      <description>
         We manage scenarios from the Scenario Controller view.  If it isn&apos;t open, open the <b>Window/Show View</b> menu, then select <b>Scenario Controller</b>.

      Next, individually (or collectively) drag and drop our new scenario and control file onto the scenario controller. Once they&apos;ve loaded, you&apos;ll see their filenames in the <b>Scenario file</b> and <b>Control file</b> labels.  You will also see the scenario itself listed in the table in the lower half of the scenario controller tab.  Only once scenario is listed - that&apos;s because our control file didn&apos;t specify that scenario generation should happen.  Select this single scenario, and you will see the <b>Init</b> button has become enabled - ready to start the run.

         title="Open the plot viewer">
      <description>
         Just to give a warm feeling that something&apos;s actually happening, open a graphical plot of the scenario by clicking on the Scenario Controller&apos;s globe icon. You&apos;ll see the fishing vessel shown in the centre of the screen, with it&apos;s status shown as inactive.  If the fishing vessel doesn&apos;t appear, just select the scenario in the table again - to indicate to the plot what we want to look at.

         title="Open the Layer Manager">
      <description>
         You can also have a look at the scenario in a tree-type view by opening the Layer Manager.  You&apos;ll see that the simulation is represented as two top-level items, one for the scenario itself, and the other for the scenario controller (generator).

         title="Start the run">
      <description>
         Right, now we&apos;re ready to go.  Switch to the Time Controller.  If the time controller has a row of 7 buttons on it, then it hasn&apos;t seen that we&apos;re actually trying to control a simulation - so select the Scenario Controller once more, which should update the Time Controller.
<br/>
Once the time controller has updated (to show just 3 buttons), click the right-hand button once.  A number of things will now have happened.  The Scenario Controller will show the scenario time as it&apos;s Status - and the icon will have dissappeared from the grpahical plot.  Don&apos;t worry, this is just because we were zoomed in too far on the fishing vessel. Click <b>Zoom Out</b> from the main toolbar about a dozen times to show us a wider overview.

         title="Move forward">
      <description>
         Now, repeatedly push the right-hand (small step) button of the Time Controller and you&apos;ll see the scenario steadily move forward in time - on all relevant views. On the plot, you&apos;ll also see that the fishing vessel is annotated with its current status.
      </description>

   <item
         title="Start scenario playing forward">
      <description>
         Now we can get the scenario to play forwards on its own - by clicking on the <b>Play</b> button in the middle of the Time Controller buttons.  You&apos;ll see the scenario start to move forward - incrementing by the 10 minute time step we specified earlier. Zoom out further if the fisherman has wandered off your viewpoint. <b>Note</b>, if you don&apos;t have a zoom out button on the toolbar, select <b>Open Perspective</b> from the View menu, and select <b>Tactical Analysis</b> from the perspectives offered.  ASSET will re-adjust itself to show the Debrief toolbar, after which you can then switch back to <b>Tactical Simulation</b>.

         title="Monitor a participant">
      <description>
         There&apos;s one last interactive thing to look at. Open the <b>Vessel Monitor</b> view - this shows us the current status of any participant.  We instruct the vessel monitor which vessel to display by selecting it in the Layer Manager.  Open the tree node representing the scenario (prob <b>Cheat sheet scenario</b>), then select <b>Fisher One</b> from it.  You&apos;ll see the Vessel monitor update to show this participant.
<br/>
Chances are, you&apos;ll have to do some view re-arranging to see of this information - observe that the vessel monitor rescales to suit the available space.
<br/>
If the scenario is still running, every now and then the fisherman will change course - and you&apos;ll see the course change in the vessel monitor.  Yes, it&apos;s quite a boring vessel to watch.

         title="Run on to the end of the scenario">
      <description>
         As you&apos;ll remember, we created an observer to stop the scenario after 24 hours.  We&apos;re going to &apos;fast forward&apos; to this finish point. Switch to the TimeController, and quickly press the &apos;little step foward&apos; button lots of times to forward through 24 hours. Eventually, the scenario will stop stepping forwards, and the Scenario Controller will show why the scenario stopped.  Once the scenario does finish, ASSET will produce the track plot we requested.
