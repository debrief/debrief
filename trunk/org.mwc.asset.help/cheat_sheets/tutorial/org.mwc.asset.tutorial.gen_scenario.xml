         <b>In this part of the tutorial you are going to create a new, empty scenario file - then populate it with sample data.</b>

         Some thinking first.  Have a look in your navigator view, and decide on a location for your new scenario file.  It isn&apos;t all that tidy to put it into the existing AssetData sample data folder, so you could create a new folder in the root of your project (by right-clicking on the root folder and selecting &apos;New Folder&apos;.  The new folder could be called &apos;trials&apos;, for example.

      <description>
         Now that you know where to put the new scenario, right click on the parent folder and select <b>New \ Other...</b>.  From the tree of available wizards, select &apos;XML&apos; from the &apos;XML&apos; folder. Now press &apos;Next&apos;.  On the next page of the wizard, provide a filename for the new scenario - how about <b>trial1.asset</b>.  On the next page, select  <b>Create XML file from an XML schema file</b>.  Obviously, now Asset wants to know which schema (model definition) file to use, so select <b>Select file from workspace</b> and browse to <b>ASSET.XSD</b> in your sample data folder.  On the next page you must specify a root element, select &apos;Scenario&apos; - and you&apos;re done.  The file will then open.

         Your new scenario will probably open in <b>Source</b> view.  This is ok fo geeks, but you may find it easier to use the tree oriented view.  Switch to this by clicking on the <b>Design</b> tab at the foot of the editor pane.  

Now your in the graphic view, experiment with expanding the <b>Scenario</b>.  

By the way, if you look at ASSET&apos;s <b>Outline</b> view (or click the arrow below) you&apos;ll see an outline view of the current sceanrio.

ASSET&apos;s Properties view is also useful when working with scenario files.  Open the properties view by selecting Window/Show View/Properties.  Now, you are able to edit the attributes for any element selected in the editor view.

         Youve got big dreams? You want fame? Well, fame costs.  And right here is where you start paying in sweat.

Well, not quite, but you do have to start typing now.  So, open the Scenario element, and give the scenario a name &apos;Cheat sheet scenario&apos;.  If you switch to the properties view you&apos;ll see the other attributes needed: <b>Created</b> and <b>StartTime</b>. ASSET expects dates in the ISO 8601 date standard: <b>2010-01-12T12:13:14Z</b>.  Put in today&apos;s date as the created attribute, and any old date as the StartTime attribute.

Next, specify how far in time the scenario should step forward (<b>StepTime</b>). Have a go at one minute: <b>Minutes</b> are the <b>Unit</b> and 1 is the <b>Value</b>.

Read more about the attributes of the scenario element using the help link below.

         Now we have to give the scenario an environment.  Do this by right-clicking on the <b>Scenario</b> and selecting <b>Add child</b> / <b>Environment</b>.  Also, give it a name - how about <b>Atlantic Summer</b>.  Play with the sea state and atmospheric attenuation if you wish.

      <description>
         Next, we have to put something into the scenario.  Right-click on <b>Participants</b> and select <b>Surface</b>.  If you open up the new participant, you&apos;ll see that the compulsary elements have already been included.   Now, give the vessel a name, <b>Fisher One</b> should do.

         Now it&apos;s tome to flesh out a little more of the fishing vessel.  Start off with the category - indicate that it&apos;s a <b>FISHING_VESSEL</b> of the <b>GREEN</b> force and it travels in the <b>SURFACE</b> environment.
&lt;p/&gt;
We&apos;ll leave the sensor fit empty, but we should give it an initial status.  Set the <b>Course</b> to 30, then <b>Fuel</b> to 100.  Now set the location to <b>Lat</b> of 50 and <b>Long</b> of <b>-8</b>.  Lastly, specify a <b>Speed</b> of 6 Knots.

      <description>
         Next up we have to inform ASSET regarding how the fishing vessel performs.  Enter the following data = <b>Name:</b> 9m Fisherman, <b>FuelUsageRate</b> 0.0001, <b>MinSpeed</b>0 Kts, <b>MaxSpeed</b>12 Kts, <b>AccelerationRate</b> 1 kt/sec, <b>DeceleratonRate</b> 1 kt/sec, <b>TurningCircle</b>  400 metres.

         title="Provide participant behaviour">
      <description>
         Next, we&apos;re going to indicate what the fishing vessel is up to.  We&apos;re going to make it travel to a fishing ground, and then wander around it.  Do this by right-clicking on the <b>Surface</b> element and selecting <b>Sequence</b> from the Add-Child sub-menu.  See the help link (right) for more on the Sequence behaviour. Name this sequence element &quot;Southern Trawl&quot;.  Also, mark the Sequence behaviour as being &apos;Active&apos; (by setting <b>IsActive</b> true from the properties window).

Also specify the transit speed as 9 knots.">

Fill in the Wander element by specifying a speed of 9 knots, the location to 50.4, -8.8.  Specify the height as zero, and set the range to 12 nautical miles.">
