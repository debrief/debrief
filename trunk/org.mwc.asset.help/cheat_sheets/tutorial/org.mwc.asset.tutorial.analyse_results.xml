      <description>
         So, our run is complete, we can now have a look at the outputs.  Now in this instance - we weren&apos;t asking for much, so it shouldn&apos;t take very long.

      <description>
         As you&apos;ll remember, we specified that the <b>OutputDirectory</b> should be <b>results</b>. So, in your <b>Navigator</b> view, check for the presence of the <b>results</b> folder.  And have a look inside.

         In the results folder you&apos;ll find a number of files.  One of which will be the product of the <b>TrackPlotObserver</b>, a <b>.png</b> file.  Double-click on this file, and Windows will show the image created - produced by Debrief.

         As well as Debrief producing a snapshot overview of the run, we can run through the scenario using Debrief.  To do this, double-click on the <b>.rep</b> file in the results folder.  As the plot opens, you may get invited to select between <b>DR</b> and <b>OTG</b> track mode - select OTG.  The file will open in Debrief.  If you select the <b>Time Controller</b> view, you can move back and forth through the scenario. <br/>

      <description>
         Lastly - still with the Debrief plot viewer open, if you open the <b>Narrative Viewer</b> view, you&apos;ll see a list of decisions made during the scenario. <b>Note</b>, you may have to switch to <b>Tactical Analysis</b> mode to see the Narrative Viewer.  Scroll back and forth with the Time Controller and see the fishing vessel&apos;s current decision state in the Narrative Viewer.
