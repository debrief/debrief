          GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;Version 2.1, February 1999&#xA;Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.&#xA;59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA&#xA;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies&#xA;of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.&#xA;[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also&#xA;counts&#xA;as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2,&#xA;hence&#xA;the version number 2.1.]&#xA;Preamble&#xA;The licenses for most software are designed to take away your&#xA;freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General&#xA;Public&#xA;Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and&#xA;change&#xA;free software--to make sure the software is free for all its&#xA;users.&#xA;This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some&#xA;specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of&#xA;the&#xA;Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use&#xA;it.  You&#xA;can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about&#xA;whether&#xA;this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better&#xA;strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations&#xA;below.&#xA;When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of&#xA;use,&#xA;not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make&#xA;sure that&#xA;you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and&#xA;charge&#xA;for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or&#xA;can get&#xA;it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces&#xA;of&#xA;it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can&#xA;do&#xA;these things.&#xA;To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid&#xA;distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender&#xA;these&#xA;rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities&#xA;for&#xA;you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify&#xA;it.&#xA;For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether&#xA;gratis&#xA;or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that&#xA;we gave&#xA;you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the&#xA;source&#xA;code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide&#xA;complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink&#xA;them&#xA;with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling&#xA;it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.&#xA;We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright&#xA;the&#xA;library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal&#xA;permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.&#xA;To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that&#xA;there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library&#xA;is&#xA;modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should&#xA;know&#xA;that what they have is not the original version, so that the&#xA;original&#xA;author&apos;s reputation will not be affected by problems that might&#xA;be&#xA;introduced by others.&#xA;Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence&#xA;of&#xA;any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot&#xA;effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining&#xA;a&#xA;restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist&#xA;that&#xA;any patent license obtained for a version of the library must&#xA;be&#xA;consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.&#xA;Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the&#xA;ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser&#xA;General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries,&#xA;and&#xA;is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.&#xA;We use&#xA;this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking&#xA;those&#xA;libraries into non-free programs.&#xA;When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or&#xA;using&#xA;a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking&#xA;a&#xA;combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary&#xA;General Public License therefore permits such linking only if&#xA;the&#xA;entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser&#xA;General&#xA;Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code&#xA;with&#xA;the library.&#xA;We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because&#xA;it&#xA;does Less to protect the user&apos;s freedom than the ordinary General&#xA;Public License.  It also provides other free software developers&#xA;Less&#xA;of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages&#xA;are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for&#xA;many&#xA;libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in&#xA;certain&#xA;special circumstances.&#xA;For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to&#xA;encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that&#xA;it becomes&#xA;a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must&#xA;be&#xA;allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free&#xA;library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.&#xA;In this&#xA;case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to&#xA;free&#xA;software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.&#xA;In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free&#xA;programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body&#xA;of&#xA;free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library&#xA;in&#xA;non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU&#xA;operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating&#xA;system.&#xA;Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective&#xA;of the&#xA;users&apos; freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that&#xA;is&#xA;linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to&#xA;run&#xA;that program using a modified version of the Library.&#xA;The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between&#xA;a&#xA;&quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;.&#xA;The&#xA;former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter&#xA;must&#xA;be combined with the library in order to run.&#xA;GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION&#xA;0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or&#xA;other&#xA;program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder&#xA;or&#xA;other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the&#xA;terms of&#xA;this Lesser General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;).&#xA;Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.&#xA;A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data&#xA;prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs&#xA;(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.&#xA;The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or&#xA;work&#xA;which has been distributed under these terms.  A &quot;work based&#xA;on the&#xA;Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under&#xA;copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library&#xA;or a&#xA;portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated&#xA;straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation&#xA;is&#xA;included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)&#xA;&quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work&#xA;for&#xA;making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code&#xA;means&#xA;all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated&#xA;interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control&#xA;compilation&#xA;and installation of the library.&#xA;Activities other than copying, distribution and modification&#xA;are not&#xA;covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act&#xA;of&#xA;running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output&#xA;from&#xA;such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work&#xA;based&#xA;on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool&#xA;for&#xA;writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library&#xA;does&#xA;and what the program that uses the Library does.&#xA;1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library&apos;s&#xA;complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided&#xA;that&#xA;you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an&#xA;appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep&#xA;intact&#xA;all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence&#xA;of any&#xA;warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the&#xA;Library.&#xA;You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,&#xA;and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange&#xA;for a&#xA;fee.&#xA;2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion&#xA;of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and&#xA;distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section&#xA;1&#xA;above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;a) The modified work must itself be a software library.&#xA;b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices&#xA;stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.&#xA;c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no&#xA;charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.&#xA;d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function&#xA;or a&#xA;table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses&#xA;the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility&#xA;is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure&#xA;that,&#xA;in the event an application does not supply such function or&#xA;table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part&#xA;of&#xA;its purpose remains meaningful.&#xA;(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots&#xA;has&#xA;a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the&#xA;application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any&#xA;application-supplied function or table used by this function&#xA;must&#xA;be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square&#xA;root function must still compute square roots.)&#xA;These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If&#xA;identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,&#xA;and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works&#xA;in&#xA;themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to&#xA;those&#xA;sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when&#xA;you&#xA;distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work&#xA;based&#xA;on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the&#xA;terms of&#xA;this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to&#xA;the&#xA;entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who&#xA;wrote&#xA;it.&#xA;Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or&#xA;contest&#xA;your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent&#xA;is to&#xA;exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative&#xA;or&#xA;collective works based on the Library.&#xA;In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the&#xA;Library&#xA;with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume&#xA;of&#xA;a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work&#xA;under&#xA;the scope of this License.&#xA;3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General&#xA;Public&#xA;License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.&#xA;To do&#xA;this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License,&#xA;so&#xA;that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version&#xA;2,&#xA;instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version&#xA;2 of the&#xA;ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can&#xA;specify&#xA;that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change&#xA;in&#xA;these notices.&#xA;Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible&#xA;for&#xA;that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies&#xA;to all&#xA;subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.&#xA;This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code&#xA;of&#xA;the Library into a program that is not a library.&#xA;4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or&#xA;derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable&#xA;form&#xA;under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany&#xA;it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code,&#xA;which&#xA;must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above&#xA;on a&#xA;medium customarily used for software interchange.&#xA;If distribution of object code is made by offering access to&#xA;copy&#xA;from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy&#xA;the&#xA;source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to&#xA;distribute the source code, even though third parties are not&#xA;compelled to copy the source along with the object code.&#xA;5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the&#xA;Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled&#xA;or&#xA;linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;.  Such&#xA;a&#xA;work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library,&#xA;and&#xA;therefore falls outside the scope of this License.&#xA;However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library&#xA;creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because&#xA;it&#xA;contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses&#xA;the&#xA;library&quot;.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.&#xA;Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.&#xA;When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header&#xA;file&#xA;that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may&#xA;be a&#xA;derivative work of the Library even though the source code is&#xA;not.&#xA;Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can&#xA;be&#xA;linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.&#xA;The&#xA;threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.&#xA;If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data&#xA;structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline&#xA;functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the&#xA;object&#xA;file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative&#xA;work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions&#xA;of the&#xA;Library will still fall under Section 6.)&#xA;Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may&#xA;distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section&#xA;6.&#xA;Any executables containing that work also fall under Section&#xA;6,&#xA;whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.&#xA;6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine&#xA;or&#xA;link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce&#xA;a&#xA;work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that&#xA;work&#xA;under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit&#xA;modification of the work for the customer&apos;s own use and reverse&#xA;engineering for debugging such modifications.&#xA;You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that&#xA;the&#xA;Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered&#xA;by&#xA;this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the&#xA;work&#xA;during execution displays copyright notices, you must include&#xA;the&#xA;copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference&#xA;directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must&#xA;do one&#xA;of these things:&#xA;a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding&#xA;machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever&#xA;changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under&#xA;Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked&#xA;with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that&#xA;uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that&#xA;the&#xA;user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified&#xA;executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood&#xA;that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in&#xA;the&#xA;Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application&#xA;to use the modified definitions.)&#xA;b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the&#xA;Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time&#xA;a&#xA;copy of the library already present on the user&apos;s computer system,&#xA;rather than copying library functions into the executable, and&#xA;(2)&#xA;will operate properly with a modified version of the library,&#xA;if&#xA;the user installs one, as long as the modified version is&#xA;interface-compatible with the version that the work was made&#xA;with.&#xA;c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at&#xA;least three years, to give the same user the materials&#xA;specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more&#xA;than the cost of performing this distribution.&#xA;d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to&#xA;copy&#xA;from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the&#xA;above&#xA;specified materials from the same place.&#xA;e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these&#xA;materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.&#xA;For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the&#xA;Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for&#xA;reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,&#xA;the materials to be distributed need not include anything that&#xA;is&#xA;normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the&#xA;major&#xA;components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system&#xA;on&#xA;which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies&#xA;the executable.&#xA;It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license&#xA;restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally&#xA;accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you&#xA;cannot&#xA;use both them and the Library together in an executable that&#xA;you&#xA;distribute.&#xA;7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on&#xA;the&#xA;Library side-by-side in a single library together with other&#xA;library&#xA;facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a&#xA;combined&#xA;library, provided that the separate distribution of the work&#xA;based on&#xA;the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise&#xA;permitted, and provided that you do these two things:&#xA;a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work&#xA;based on the Library, uncombined with any other library&#xA;facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the&#xA;Sections above.&#xA;b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact&#xA;that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining&#xA;where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.&#xA;8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute&#xA;the Library except as expressly provided under this License.&#xA;Any&#xA;attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or&#xA;distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate&#xA;your&#xA;rights under this License.  However, parties who have received&#xA;copies,&#xA;or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses&#xA;terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.&#xA;9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have&#xA;not&#xA;signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify&#xA;or&#xA;distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions&#xA;are&#xA;prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore,&#xA;by&#xA;modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the&#xA;Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do&#xA;so, and&#xA;all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying&#xA;the Library or works based on it.&#xA;10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based&#xA;on the&#xA;Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from&#xA;the&#xA;original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the&#xA;Library&#xA;subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any&#xA;further&#xA;restrictions on the recipients&apos; exercise of the rights granted&#xA;herein.&#xA;You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties&#xA;with&#xA;this License.&#xA;11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of&#xA;patent&#xA;infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),&#xA;conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement&#xA;or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they&#xA;do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot&#xA;distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under&#xA;this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence&#xA;you&#xA;may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent&#xA;license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library&#xA;by&#xA;all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you,&#xA;then&#xA;the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would&#xA;be to&#xA;refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.&#xA;If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable&#xA;under any&#xA;particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended&#xA;to apply,&#xA;and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.&#xA;It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe&#xA;any&#xA;patents or other property right claims or to contest validity&#xA;of any&#xA;such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting&#xA;the&#xA;integrity of the free software distribution system which is&#xA;implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made&#xA;generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed&#xA;through that system in reliance on consistent application of&#xA;that&#xA;system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is&#xA;willing&#xA;to distribute software through any other system and a licensee&#xA;cannot&#xA;impose that choice.&#xA;This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed&#xA;to&#xA;be a consequence of the rest of this License.&#xA;12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted&#xA;in&#xA;certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,&#xA;the&#xA;original copyright holder who places the Library under this License&#xA;may add&#xA;an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those&#xA;countries,&#xA;so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries&#xA;not thus&#xA;excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation&#xA;as if&#xA;written in the body of this License.&#xA;13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new&#xA;versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.&#xA;Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,&#xA;but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.&#xA;Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&#xA;Library&#xA;specifies a version number of this License which applies to it&#xA;and&#xA;&quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms&#xA;and&#xA;conditions either of that version or of any later version published&#xA;by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify&#xA;a&#xA;license version number, you may choose any version ever published&#xA;by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation.&#xA;14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other&#xA;free&#xA;programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with&#xA;these,&#xA;write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which&#xA;is&#xA;copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free&#xA;Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. &#xA;Our&#xA;decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free&#xA;status&#xA;of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the&#xA;sharing&#xA;and reuse of software generally.&#xA;NO WARRANTY&#xA;15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS&#xA;NO&#xA;WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE&#xA;LAW.&#xA;EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS&#xA;AND/OR&#xA;OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF&#xA;ANY&#xA;KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED&#xA;TO, THE&#xA;IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#xA;PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF&#xA;THE&#xA;LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU&#xA;ASSUME&#xA;THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;16.

          GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;Version 2.1, February 1999&#xA;Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.&#xA;59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA&#xA;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies&#xA;of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.&#xA;[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also&#xA;counts&#xA;as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2,&#xA;hence&#xA;the version number 2.1.]&#xA;Preamble&#xA;The licenses for most software are designed to take away your&#xA;freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General&#xA;Public&#xA;Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and&#xA;change&#xA;free software--to make sure the software is free for all its&#xA;users.&#xA;This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some&#xA;specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of&#xA;the&#xA;Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use&#xA;it.  You&#xA;can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about&#xA;whether&#xA;this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better&#xA;strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations&#xA;below.&#xA;When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of&#xA;use,&#xA;not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make&#xA;sure that&#xA;you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and&#xA;charge&#xA;for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or&#xA;can get&#xA;it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces&#xA;of&#xA;it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can&#xA;do&#xA;these things.&#xA;To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid&#xA;distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender&#xA;these&#xA;rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities&#xA;for&#xA;you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify&#xA;it.&#xA;For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether&#xA;gratis&#xA;or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that&#xA;we gave&#xA;you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the&#xA;source&#xA;code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide&#xA;complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink&#xA;them&#xA;with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling&#xA;it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.&#xA;We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright&#xA;the&#xA;library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal&#xA;permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.&#xA;To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that&#xA;there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library&#xA;is&#xA;modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should&#xA;know&#xA;that what they have is not the original version, so that the&#xA;original&#xA;author&apos;s reputation will not be affected by problems that might&#xA;be&#xA;introduced by others.&#xA;Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence&#xA;of&#xA;any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot&#xA;effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining&#xA;a&#xA;restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist&#xA;that&#xA;any patent license obtained for a version of the library must&#xA;be&#xA;consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.&#xA;Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the&#xA;ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser&#xA;General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries,&#xA;and&#xA;is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.&#xA;We use&#xA;this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking&#xA;those&#xA;libraries into non-free programs.&#xA;When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or&#xA;using&#xA;a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking&#xA;a&#xA;combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary&#xA;General Public License therefore permits such linking only if&#xA;the&#xA;entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser&#xA;General&#xA;Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code&#xA;with&#xA;the library.&#xA;We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because&#xA;it&#xA;does Less to protect the user&apos;s freedom than the ordinary General&#xA;Public License.  It also provides other free software developers&#xA;Less&#xA;of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages&#xA;are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for&#xA;many&#xA;libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in&#xA;certain&#xA;special circumstances.&#xA;For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to&#xA;encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that&#xA;it becomes&#xA;a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must&#xA;be&#xA;allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free&#xA;library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.&#xA;In this&#xA;case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to&#xA;free&#xA;software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.&#xA;In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free&#xA;programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body&#xA;of&#xA;free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library&#xA;in&#xA;non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU&#xA;operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating&#xA;system.&#xA;Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective&#xA;of the&#xA;users&apos; freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that&#xA;is&#xA;linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to&#xA;run&#xA;that program using a modified version of the Library.&#xA;The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between&#xA;a&#xA;&quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;.&#xA;The&#xA;former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter&#xA;must&#xA;be combined with the library in order to run.&#xA;GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION&#xA;0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or&#xA;other&#xA;program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder&#xA;or&#xA;other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the&#xA;terms of&#xA;this Lesser General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;).&#xA;Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.&#xA;A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data&#xA;prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs&#xA;(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.&#xA;The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or&#xA;work&#xA;which has been distributed under these terms.  A &quot;work based&#xA;on the&#xA;Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under&#xA;copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library&#xA;or a&#xA;portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated&#xA;straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation&#xA;is&#xA;included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)&#xA;&quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work&#xA;for&#xA;making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code&#xA;means&#xA;all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated&#xA;interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control&#xA;compilation&#xA;and installation of the library.&#xA;Activities other than copying, distribution and modification&#xA;are not&#xA;covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act&#xA;of&#xA;running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output&#xA;from&#xA;such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work&#xA;based&#xA;on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool&#xA;for&#xA;writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library&#xA;does&#xA;and what the program that uses the Library does.&#xA;1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library&apos;s&#xA;complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided&#xA;that&#xA;you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an&#xA;appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep&#xA;intact&#xA;all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence&#xA;of any&#xA;warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the&#xA;Library.&#xA;You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,&#xA;and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange&#xA;for a&#xA;fee.&#xA;2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion&#xA;of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and&#xA;distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section&#xA;1&#xA;above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;a) The modified work must itself be a software library.&#xA;b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices&#xA;stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.&#xA;c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no&#xA;charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.&#xA;d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function&#xA;or a&#xA;table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses&#xA;the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility&#xA;is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure&#xA;that,&#xA;in the event an application does not supply such function or&#xA;table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part&#xA;of&#xA;its purpose remains meaningful.&#xA;(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots&#xA;has&#xA;a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the&#xA;application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any&#xA;application-supplied function or table used by this function&#xA;must&#xA;be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square&#xA;root function must still compute square roots.)&#xA;These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If&#xA;identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,&#xA;and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works&#xA;in&#xA;themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to&#xA;those&#xA;sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when&#xA;you&#xA;distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work&#xA;based&#xA;on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the&#xA;terms of&#xA;this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to&#xA;the&#xA;entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who&#xA;wrote&#xA;it.&#xA;Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or&#xA;contest&#xA;your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent&#xA;is to&#xA;exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative&#xA;or&#xA;collective works based on the Library.&#xA;In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the&#xA;Library&#xA;with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume&#xA;of&#xA;a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work&#xA;under&#xA;the scope of this License.&#xA;3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General&#xA;Public&#xA;License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.&#xA;To do&#xA;this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License,&#xA;so&#xA;that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version&#xA;2,&#xA;instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version&#xA;2 of the&#xA;ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can&#xA;specify&#xA;that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change&#xA;in&#xA;these notices.&#xA;Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible&#xA;for&#xA;that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies&#xA;to all&#xA;subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.&#xA;This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code&#xA;of&#xA;the Library into a program that is not a library.&#xA;4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or&#xA;derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable&#xA;form&#xA;under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany&#xA;it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code,&#xA;which&#xA;must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above&#xA;on a&#xA;medium customarily used for software interchange.&#xA;If distribution of object code is made by offering access to&#xA;copy&#xA;from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy&#xA;the&#xA;source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to&#xA;distribute the source code, even though third parties are not&#xA;compelled to copy the source along with the object code.&#xA;5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the&#xA;Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled&#xA;or&#xA;linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;.  Such&#xA;a&#xA;work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library,&#xA;and&#xA;therefore falls outside the scope of this License.&#xA;However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library&#xA;creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because&#xA;it&#xA;contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses&#xA;the&#xA;library&quot;.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.&#xA;Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.&#xA;When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header&#xA;file&#xA;that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may&#xA;be a&#xA;derivative work of the Library even though the source code is&#xA;not.&#xA;Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can&#xA;be&#xA;linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.&#xA;The&#xA;threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.&#xA;If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data&#xA;structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline&#xA;functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the&#xA;object&#xA;file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative&#xA;work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions&#xA;of the&#xA;Library will still fall under Section 6.)&#xA;Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may&#xA;distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section&#xA;6.&#xA;Any executables containing that work also fall under Section&#xA;6,&#xA;whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.&#xA;6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine&#xA;or&#xA;link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce&#xA;a&#xA;work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that&#xA;work&#xA;under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit&#xA;modification of the work for the customer&apos;s own use and reverse&#xA;engineering for debugging such modifications.&#xA;You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that&#xA;the&#xA;Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered&#xA;by&#xA;this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the&#xA;work&#xA;during execution displays copyright notices, you must include&#xA;the&#xA;copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference&#xA;directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must&#xA;do one&#xA;of these things:&#xA;a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding&#xA;machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever&#xA;changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under&#xA;Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked&#xA;with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that&#xA;uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that&#xA;the&#xA;user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified&#xA;executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood&#xA;that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in&#xA;the&#xA;Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application&#xA;to use the modified definitions.)&#xA;b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the&#xA;Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time&#xA;a&#xA;copy of the library already present on the user&apos;s computer system,&#xA;rather than copying library functions into the executable, and&#xA;(2)&#xA;will operate properly with a modified version of the library,&#xA;if&#xA;the user installs one, as long as the modified version is&#xA;interface-compatible with the version that the work was made&#xA;with.&#xA;c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at&#xA;least three years, to give the same user the materials&#xA;specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more&#xA;than the cost of performing this distribution.&#xA;d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to&#xA;copy&#xA;from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the&#xA;above&#xA;specified materials from the same place.&#xA;e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these&#xA;materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.&#xA;For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the&#xA;Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for&#xA;reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,&#xA;the materials to be distributed need not include anything that&#xA;is&#xA;normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the&#xA;major&#xA;components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system&#xA;on&#xA;which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies&#xA;the executable.&#xA;It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license&#xA;restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally&#xA;accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you&#xA;cannot&#xA;use both them and the Library together in an executable that&#xA;you&#xA;distribute.&#xA;7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on&#xA;the&#xA;Library side-by-side in a single library together with other&#xA;library&#xA;facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a&#xA;combined&#xA;library, provided that the separate distribution of the work&#xA;based on&#xA;the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise&#xA;permitted, and provided that you do these two things:&#xA;a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work&#xA;based on the Library, uncombined with any other library&#xA;facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the&#xA;Sections above.&#xA;b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact&#xA;that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining&#xA;where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.&#xA;8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute&#xA;the Library except as expressly provided under this License.&#xA;Any&#xA;attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or&#xA;distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate&#xA;your&#xA;rights under this License.  However, parties who have received&#xA;copies,&#xA;or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses&#xA;terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.&#xA;9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have&#xA;not&#xA;signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify&#xA;or&#xA;distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions&#xA;are&#xA;prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore,&#xA;by&#xA;modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the&#xA;Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do&#xA;so, and&#xA;all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying&#xA;the Library or works based on it.&#xA;10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based&#xA;on the&#xA;Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from&#xA;the&#xA;original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the&#xA;Library&#xA;subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any&#xA;further&#xA;restrictions on the recipients&apos; exercise of the rights granted&#xA;herein.&#xA;You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties&#xA;with&#xA;this License.&#xA;11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of&#xA;patent&#xA;infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),&#xA;conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement&#xA;or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they&#xA;do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot&#xA;distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under&#xA;this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence&#xA;you&#xA;may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent&#xA;license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library&#xA;by&#xA;all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you,&#xA;then&#xA;the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would&#xA;be to&#xA;refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.&#xA;If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable&#xA;under any&#xA;particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended&#xA;to apply,&#xA;and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.&#xA;It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe&#xA;any&#xA;patents or other property right claims or to contest validity&#xA;of any&#xA;such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting&#xA;the&#xA;integrity of the free software distribution system which is&#xA;implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made&#xA;generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed&#xA;through that system in reliance on consistent application of&#xA;that&#xA;system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is&#xA;willing&#xA;to distribute software through any other system and a licensee&#xA;cannot&#xA;impose that choice.&#xA;This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed&#xA;to&#xA;be a consequence of the rest of this License.&#xA;12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted&#xA;in&#xA;certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,&#xA;the&#xA;original copyright holder who places the Library under this License&#xA;may add&#xA;an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those&#xA;countries,&#xA;so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries&#xA;not thus&#xA;excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation&#xA;as if&#xA;written in the body of this License.&#xA;13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new&#xA;versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.&#xA;Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,&#xA;but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.&#xA;Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&#xA;Library&#xA;specifies a version number of this License which applies to it&#xA;and&#xA;&quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms&#xA;and&#xA;conditions either of that version or of any later version published&#xA;by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify&#xA;a&#xA;license version number, you may choose any version ever published&#xA;by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation.&#xA;14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other&#xA;free&#xA;programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with&#xA;these,&#xA;write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which&#xA;is&#xA;copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free&#xA;Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. &#xA;Our&#xA;decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free&#xA;status&#xA;of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the&#xA;sharing&#xA;and reuse of software generally.&#xA;NO WARRANTY&#xA;15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS&#xA;NO&#xA;WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE&#xA;LAW.&#xA;EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS&#xA;AND/OR&#xA;OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF&#xA;ANY&#xA;KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED&#xA;TO, THE&#xA;IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#xA;PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF&#xA;THE&#xA;LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU&#xA;ASSUME&#xA;THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO&#xA;IN&#xA;WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY&#xA;MODIFY&#xA;AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE&#xA;TO YOU&#xA;FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR&#xA;CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO&#xA;USE THE&#xA;LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING&#xA;RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES&#xA;OR A&#xA;FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN&#xA;IF&#xA;SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY&#xA;OF SUCH&#xA;DAMAGES.&#xA;END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries&#xA;If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest&#xA;possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software&#xA;that&#xA;everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting&#xA;redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the&#xA;terms of the&#xA;ordinary General Public License).&#xA;To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.&#xA;It is&#xA;safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most&#xA;effectively&#xA;convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at&#xA;least the&#xA;&quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.&#xA;&lt;one line to give the library&apos;s name and a brief idea of what&#xA;it does.&gt;&#xA;Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;&#xA;This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or&#xA;modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either&#xA;version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.&#xA;This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,&#xA;but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of&#xA;MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the&#xA;GNU&#xA;Lesser General Public License for more details.&#xA;You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software&#xA;Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307&#xA;USA&#xA;Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and&#xA;paper mail.&#xA;You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer)&#xA;or your&#xA;school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the library,&#xA;if&#xA;necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:&#xA;Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the&#xA;library `Frob&apos; (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James&#xA;Random Hacker.&#xA;&lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1990&#xA;Ty Coon, President of Vice&#xA;That&apos;s all there is to it!

          GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;Version 2.1, February 1999&#xA;Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.&#xA;59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA&#xA;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies&#xA;of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.&#xA;[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also&#xA;counts&#xA;as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2,&#xA;hence&#xA;the version number 2.1.]&#xA;Preamble&#xA;The licenses for most software are designed to take away your&#xA;freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General&#xA;Public&#xA;Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and&#xA;change&#xA;free software--to make sure the software is free for all its&#xA;users.&#xA;This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some&#xA;specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of&#xA;the&#xA;Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use&#xA;it.  You&#xA;can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about&#xA;whether&#xA;this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better&#xA;strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations&#xA;below.&#xA;When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of&#xA;use,&#xA;not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make&#xA;sure that&#xA;you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and&#xA;charge&#xA;for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or&#xA;can get&#xA;it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces&#xA;of&#xA;it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can&#xA;do&#xA;these things.&#xA;To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid&#xA;distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender&#xA;these&#xA;rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities&#xA;for&#xA;you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify&#xA;it.&#xA;For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether&#xA;gratis&#xA;or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that&#xA;we gave&#xA;you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the&#xA;source&#xA;code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide&#xA;complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink&#xA;them&#xA;with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling&#xA;it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.&#xA;We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright&#xA;the&#xA;library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal&#xA;permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.&#xA;To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that&#xA;there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library&#xA;is&#xA;modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should&#xA;know&#xA;that what they have is not the original version, so that the&#xA;original&#xA;author&apos;s reputation will not be affected by problems that might&#xA;be&#xA;introduced by others.&#xA;Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence&#xA;of&#xA;any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot&#xA;effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining&#xA;a&#xA;restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist&#xA;that&#xA;any patent license obtained for a version of the library must&#xA;be&#xA;consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.&#xA;Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the&#xA;ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser&#xA;General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries,&#xA;and&#xA;is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.&#xA;We use&#xA;this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking&#xA;those&#xA;libraries into non-free programs.&#xA;When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or&#xA;using&#xA;a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking&#xA;a&#xA;combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary&#xA;General Public License therefore permits such linking only if&#xA;the&#xA;entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser&#xA;General&#xA;Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code&#xA;with&#xA;the library.&#xA;We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because&#xA;it&#xA;does Less to protect the user&apos;s freedom than the ordinary General&#xA;Public License.  It also provides other free software developers&#xA;Less&#xA;of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages&#xA;are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for&#xA;many&#xA;libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in&#xA;certain&#xA;special circumstances.&#xA;For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to&#xA;encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that&#xA;it becomes&#xA;a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must&#xA;be&#xA;allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free&#xA;library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.&#xA;In this&#xA;case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to&#xA;free&#xA;software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.&#xA;In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free&#xA;programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body&#xA;of&#xA;free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library&#xA;in&#xA;non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU&#xA;operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating&#xA;system.&#xA;Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective&#xA;of the&#xA;users&apos; freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that&#xA;is&#xA;linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to&#xA;run&#xA;that program using a modified version of the Library.&#xA;The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between&#xA;a&#xA;&quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;.&#xA;The&#xA;former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter&#xA;must&#xA;be combined with the library in order to run.&#xA;GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION&#xA;0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or&#xA;other&#xA;program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder&#xA;or&#xA;other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the&#xA;terms of&#xA;this Lesser General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;).&#xA;Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.&#xA;A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data&#xA;prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs&#xA;(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.&#xA;The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or&#xA;work&#xA;which has been distributed under these terms.  A &quot;work based&#xA;on the&#xA;Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under&#xA;copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library&#xA;or a&#xA;portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated&#xA;straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation&#xA;is&#xA;included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)&#xA;&quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work&#xA;for&#xA;making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code&#xA;means&#xA;all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated&#xA;interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control&#xA;compilation&#xA;and installation of the library.&#xA;Activities other than copying, distribution and modification&#xA;are not&#xA;covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act&#xA;of&#xA;running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output&#xA;from&#xA;such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work&#xA;based&#xA;on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool&#xA;for&#xA;writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library&#xA;does&#xA;and what the program that uses the Library does.&#xA;1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library&apos;s&#xA;complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided&#xA;that&#xA;you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an&#xA;appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep&#xA;intact&#xA;all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence&#xA;of any&#xA;warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the&#xA;Library.&#xA;You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,&#xA;and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange&#xA;for a&#xA;fee.&#xA;2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion&#xA;of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and&#xA;distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section&#xA;1&#xA;above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;a) The modified work must itself be a software library.&#xA;b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices&#xA;stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.&#xA;c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no&#xA;charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.&#xA;d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function&#xA;or a&#xA;table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses&#xA;the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility&#xA;is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure&#xA;that,&#xA;in the event an application does not supply such function or&#xA;table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part&#xA;of&#xA;its purpose remains meaningful.&#xA;(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots&#xA;has&#xA;a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the&#xA;application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any&#xA;application-supplied function or table used by this function&#xA;must&#xA;be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square&#xA;root function must still compute square roots.)&#xA;These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If&#xA;identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,&#xA;and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works&#xA;in&#xA;themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to&#xA;those&#xA;sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when&#xA;you&#xA;distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work&#xA;based&#xA;on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the&#xA;terms of&#xA;this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to&#xA;the&#xA;entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who&#xA;wrote&#xA;it.&#xA;Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or&#xA;contest&#xA;your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent&#xA;is to&#xA;exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative&#xA;or&#xA;collective works based on the Library.&#xA;In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the&#xA;Library&#xA;with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume&#xA;of&#xA;a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work&#xA;under&#xA;the scope of this License.&#xA;3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General&#xA;Public&#xA;License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.&#xA;To do&#xA;this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License,&#xA;so&#xA;that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version&#xA;2,&#xA;instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version&#xA;2 of the&#xA;ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can&#xA;specify&#xA;that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change&#xA;in&#xA;these notices.&#xA;Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible&#xA;for&#xA;that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies&#xA;to all&#xA;subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.&#xA;This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code&#xA;of&#xA;the Library into a program that is not a library.&#xA;4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or&#xA;derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable&#xA;form&#xA;under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany&#xA;it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code,&#xA;which&#xA;must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above&#xA;on a&#xA;medium customarily used for software interchange.&#xA;If distribution of object code is made by offering access to&#xA;copy&#xA;from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy&#xA;the&#xA;source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to&#xA;distribute the source code, even though third parties are not&#xA;compelled to copy the source along with the object code.&#xA;5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the&#xA;Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled&#xA;or&#xA;linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;.  Such&#xA;a&#xA;work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library,&#xA;and&#xA;therefore falls outside the scope of this License.&#xA;However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library&#xA;creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because&#xA;it&#xA;contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses&#xA;the&#xA;library&quot;.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.&#xA;Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.&#xA;When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header&#xA;file&#xA;that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may&#xA;be a&#xA;derivative work of the Library even though the source code is&#xA;not.&#xA;Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can&#xA;be&#xA;linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.&#xA;The&#xA;threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.&#xA;If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data&#xA;structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline&#xA;functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the&#xA;object&#xA;file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative&#xA;work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions&#xA;of the&#xA;Library will still fall under Section 6.)&#xA;Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may&#xA;distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section&#xA;6.&#xA;Any executables containing that work also fall under Section&#xA;6,&#xA;whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.&#xA;6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine&#xA;or&#xA;link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce&#xA;a&#xA;work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that&#xA;work&#xA;under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit&#xA;modification of the work for the customer&apos;s own use and reverse&#xA;engineering for debugging such modifications.&#xA;You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that&#xA;the&#xA;Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered&#xA;by&#xA;this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the&#xA;work&#xA;during execution displays copyright notices, you must include&#xA;the&#xA;copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference&#xA;directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must&#xA;do one&#xA;of these things:&#xA;a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding&#xA;machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever&#xA;changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under&#xA;Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked&#xA;with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that&#xA;uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that&#xA;the&#xA;user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified&#xA;executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood&#xA;that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in&#xA;the&#xA;Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application&#xA;to use the modified definitions.)&#xA;b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the&#xA;Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time&#xA;a&#xA;copy of the library already present on the user&apos;s computer system,&#xA;rather than copying library functions into the executable, and&#xA;(2)&#xA;will operate properly with a modified version of the library,&#xA;if&#xA;the user installs one, as long as the modified version is&#xA;interface-compatible with the version that the work was made&#xA;with.&#xA;c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at&#xA;least three years, to give the same user the materials&#xA;specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more&#xA;than the cost of performing this distribution.&#xA;d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to&#xA;copy&#xA;from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the&#xA;above&#xA;specified materials from the same place.&#xA;e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these&#xA;materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.&#xA;For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the&#xA;Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for&#xA;reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,&#xA;the materials to be distributed need not include anything that&#xA;is&#xA;normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the&#xA;major&#xA;components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system&#xA;on&#xA;which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies&#xA;the executable.&#xA;It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license&#xA;restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally&#xA;accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you&#xA;cannot&#xA;use both them and the Library together in an executable that&#xA;you&#xA;distribute.&#xA;7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on&#xA;the&#xA;Library side-by-side in a single library together with other&#xA;library&#xA;facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a&#xA;combined&#xA;library, provided that the separate distribution of the work&#xA;based on&#xA;the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise&#xA;permitted, and provided that you do these two things:&#xA;a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work&#xA;based on the Library, uncombined with any other library&#xA;facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the&#xA;Sections above.&#xA;b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact&#xA;that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining&#xA;where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.&#xA;8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute&#xA;the Library except as expressly provided under this License.&#xA;Any&#xA;attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or&#xA;distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate&#xA;your&#xA;rights under this License.  However, parties who have received&#xA;copies,&#xA;or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses&#xA;terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.&#xA;9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have&#xA;not&#xA;signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify&#xA;or&#xA;distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions&#xA;are&#xA;prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore,&#xA;by&#xA;modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the&#xA;Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do&#xA;so, and&#xA;all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying&#xA;the Library or works based on it.&#xA;10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based&#xA;on the&#xA;Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from&#xA;the&#xA;original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the&#xA;Library&#xA;subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any&#xA;further&#xA;restrictions on the recipients&apos; exercise of the rights granted&#xA;herein.&#xA;You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties&#xA;with&#xA;this License.&#xA;11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of&#xA;patent&#xA;infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),&#xA;conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement&#xA;or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they&#xA;do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot&#xA;distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under&#xA;this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence&#xA;you&#xA;may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent&#xA;license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library&#xA;by&#xA;all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you,&#xA;then&#xA;the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would&#xA;be to&#xA;refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.&#xA;If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable&#xA;under any&#xA;particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended&#xA;to apply,&#xA;and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.&#xA;It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe&#xA;any&#xA;patents or other property right claims or to contest validity&#xA;of any&#xA;such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting&#xA;the&#xA;integrity of the free software distribution system which is&#xA;implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made&#xA;generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed&#xA;through that system in reliance on consistent application of&#xA;that&#xA;system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is&#xA;willing&#xA;to distribute software through any other system and a licensee&#xA;cannot&#xA;impose that choice.&#xA;This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed&#xA;to&#xA;be a consequence of the rest of this License.&#xA;12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted&#xA;in&#xA;certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,&#xA;the&#xA;original copyright holder who places the Library under this License&#xA;may add&#xA;an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those&#xA;countries,&#xA;so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries&#xA;not thus&#xA;excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation&#xA;as if&#xA;written in the body of this License.&#xA;13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new&#xA;versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.&#xA;Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,&#xA;but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.&#xA;Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&#xA;Library&#xA;specifies a version number of this License which applies to it&#xA;and&#xA;&quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms&#xA;and&#xA;conditions either of that version or of any later version published&#xA;by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify&#xA;a&#xA;license version number, you may choose any version ever published&#xA;by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation.&#xA;14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other&#xA;free&#xA;programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with&#xA;these,&#xA;write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which&#xA;is&#xA;copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free&#xA;Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. &#xA;Our&#xA;decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free&#xA;status&#xA;of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the&#xA;sharing&#xA;and reuse of software generally.&#xA;NO WARRANTY&#xA;15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS&#xA;NO&#xA;WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE&#xA;LAW.&#xA;EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS&#xA;AND/OR&#xA;OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF&#xA;ANY&#xA;KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED&#xA;TO, THE&#xA;IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#xA;PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF&#xA;THE&#xA;LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU&#xA;ASSUME&#xA;THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO&#xA;IN&#xA;WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY&#xA;MODIFY&#xA;AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE&#xA;TO YOU&#xA;FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR&#xA;CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO&#xA;USE THE&#xA;LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING&#xA;RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES&#xA;OR A&#xA;FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN&#xA;IF&#xA;SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY&#xA;OF SUCH&#xA;DAMAGES.&#xA;END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries&#xA;If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest&#xA;possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software&#xA;that&#xA;everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting&#xA;redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the&#xA;terms of the&#xA;ordinary General Public License).&#xA;To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.&#xA;It is&#xA;safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most&#xA;effectively&#xA;convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at&#xA;least the&#xA;&quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.&#xA;&lt;one line to give the library&apos;s name and a brief idea of what&#xA;it does.&gt;&#xA;Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;&#xA;This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or&#xA;modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either&#xA;version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.&#xA;This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,&#xA;but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of&#xA;MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the&#xA;GNU&#xA;Lesser General Public License for more details.&#xA;You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software&#xA;Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307&#xA;USA&#xA;Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and&#xA;paper mail.&#xA;You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer)&#xA;or your&#xA;school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the library,&#xA;if&#xA;necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:&#xA;Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the&#xA;library `Frob&apos; (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James&#xA;Random Hacker.&#xA;&lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1990&#xA;Ty Coon, President of Vice&#xA;That&apos;s all there is to it!

          GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;         Version 2.1, February 1999&#xA;&#xA; Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.&#xA;     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA&#xA; Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies&#xA; of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.&#xA;&#xA;[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts&#xA; as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence&#xA; the version number 2.1.]&#xA;&#xA;       Preamble&#xA;&#xA;  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your&#xA;freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public&#xA;Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change&#xA;free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.&#xA;&#xA;  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some&#xA;specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the&#xA;Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You&#xA;can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether&#xA;this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better&#xA;strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.&#xA;&#xA;  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,&#xA;not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that&#xA;you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge&#xA;for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get&#xA;it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of&#xA;it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do&#xA;these things.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid&#xA;distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these&#xA;rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for&#xA;you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis&#xA;or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave&#xA;you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source&#xA;code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide&#xA;complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them&#xA;with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling&#xA;it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.&#xA;&#xA;  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the&#xA;library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal&#xA;permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that&#xA;there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is&#xA;modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know&#xA;that what they have is not the original version, so that the original&#xA;author&apos;s reputation will not be affected by problems that might be&#xA;introduced by others.&#xA;&#xA;  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of&#xA;any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot&#xA;effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a&#xA;restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that&#xA;any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be&#xA;consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.&#xA;&#xA;  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the&#xA;ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser&#xA;General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and&#xA;is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use&#xA;this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those&#xA;libraries into non-free programs.&#xA;&#xA;  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using&#xA;a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a&#xA;combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary&#xA;General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the&#xA;entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General&#xA;Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with&#xA;the library.&#xA;&#xA;  We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because it&#xA;does Less to protect the user&apos;s freedom than the ordinary General&#xA;Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less&#xA;of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages&#xA;are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many&#xA;libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain&#xA;special circumstances.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to&#xA;encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes&#xA;a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be&#xA;allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free&#xA;library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this&#xA;case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free&#xA;software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free&#xA;programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of&#xA;free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in&#xA;non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU&#xA;operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating&#xA;system.&#xA;&#xA;  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the&#xA;users&apos; freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is&#xA;linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run&#xA;that program using a modified version of the Library.&#xA;&#xA;  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a&#xA;&quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;.  The&#xA;former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must&#xA;be combined with the library in order to run.&#xA;&#xA;    GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION&#xA;&#xA;  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other&#xA;program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or&#xA;other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of&#xA;this Lesser General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;).&#xA;Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data&#xA;prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs&#xA;(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work&#xA;which has been distributed under these terms.  A &quot;work based on the&#xA;Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under&#xA;copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a&#xA;portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated&#xA;straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is&#xA;included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for&#xA;making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means&#xA;all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated&#xA;interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation&#xA;and installation of the library.&#xA;&#xA;  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not&#xA;covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of&#xA;running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from&#xA;such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based&#xA;on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for&#xA;writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does&#xA;and what the program that uses the Library does.&#xA;  &#xA;  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library&apos;s&#xA;complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that&#xA;you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an&#xA;appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact&#xA;all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any&#xA;warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the&#xA;Library.&#xA;&#xA;  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,&#xA;and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a&#xA;fee.&#xA;&#xA;  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion&#xA;of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and&#xA;distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1&#xA;above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;&#xA;    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.&#xA;&#xA;    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices&#xA;    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.&#xA;&#xA;    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no&#xA;    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.&#xA;&#xA;    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a&#xA;    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses&#xA;    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility&#xA;    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,&#xA;    in the event an application does not supply such function or&#xA;    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of&#xA;    its purpose remains meaningful.&#xA;&#xA;    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has&#xA;    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the&#xA;    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any&#xA;    application-supplied function or table used by this function must&#xA;    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square&#xA;    root function must still compute square roots.)&#xA;&#xA;These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If&#xA;identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,&#xA;and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in&#xA;themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those&#xA;sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you&#xA;distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based&#xA;on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of&#xA;this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the&#xA;entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote&#xA;it.&#xA;&#xA;Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest&#xA;your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to&#xA;exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or&#xA;collective works based on the Library.&#xA;&#xA;In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library&#xA;with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of&#xA;a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under&#xA;the scope of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public&#xA;License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do&#xA;this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so&#xA;that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,&#xA;instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the&#xA;ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify&#xA;that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in&#xA;these notices.&#xA;&#xA;  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for&#xA;that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all&#xA;subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.&#xA;&#xA;  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of&#xA;the Library into a program that is not a library.&#xA;&#xA;  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or&#xA;derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form&#xA;under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany&#xA;it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which&#xA;must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a&#xA;medium customarily used for software interchange.&#xA;&#xA;  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy&#xA;from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the&#xA;source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to&#xA;distribute the source code, even though third parties are not&#xA;compelled to copy the source along with the object code.&#xA;&#xA;  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the&#xA;Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or&#xA;linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;.  Such a&#xA;work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and&#xA;therefore falls outside the scope of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library&#xA;creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it&#xA;contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses the&#xA;library&quot;.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.&#xA;Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.&#xA;&#xA;  When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header file&#xA;that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a&#xA;derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.&#xA;Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be&#xA;linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The&#xA;threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.&#xA;&#xA;  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data&#xA;structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline&#xA;functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object&#xA;file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative&#xA;work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the&#xA;Library will still fall under Section 6.)&#xA;&#xA;  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may&#xA;distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.&#xA;Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,&#xA;whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.&#xA;&#xA;  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or&#xA;link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce a&#xA;work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work&#xA;under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit&#xA;modification of the work for the customer&apos;s own use and reverse&#xA;engineering for debugging such modifications.&#xA;&#xA;  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the&#xA;Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by&#xA;this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work&#xA;during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the&#xA;copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference&#xA;directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one&#xA;of these things:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding&#xA;    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever&#xA;    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under&#xA;    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked&#xA;    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that&#xA;    uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that the&#xA;    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified&#xA;    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood&#xA;    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the&#xA;    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application&#xA;    to use the modified definitions.)&#xA;&#xA;    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the&#xA;    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a&#xA;    copy of the library already present on the user&apos;s computer system,&#xA;    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)&#xA;    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if&#xA;    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is&#xA;    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.&#xA;&#xA;    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at&#xA;    least three years, to give the same user the materials&#xA;    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more&#xA;    than the cost of performing this distribution.&#xA;&#xA;    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy&#xA;    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above&#xA;    specified materials from the same place.&#xA;&#xA;    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these&#xA;    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.&#xA;&#xA;  For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the&#xA;Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for&#xA;reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,&#xA;the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is&#xA;normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major&#xA;components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on&#xA;which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies&#xA;the executable.&#xA;&#xA;  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license&#xA;restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally&#xA;accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot&#xA;use both them and the Library together in an executable that you&#xA;distribute.&#xA;&#xA;  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the&#xA;Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library&#xA;facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined&#xA;library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on&#xA;the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise&#xA;permitted, and provided that you do these two things:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work&#xA;    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library&#xA;    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the&#xA;    Sections above.&#xA;&#xA;    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact&#xA;    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining&#xA;    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.&#xA;&#xA;  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute&#xA;the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any&#xA;attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or&#xA;distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your&#xA;rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,&#xA;or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses&#xA;terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.&#xA;&#xA;  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not&#xA;signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or&#xA;distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are&#xA;prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by&#xA;modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the&#xA;Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and&#xA;all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying&#xA;the Library or works based on it.&#xA;&#xA;  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the&#xA;Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the&#xA;original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library&#xA;subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further&#xA;restrictions on the recipients&apos; exercise of the rights granted herein.&#xA;You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with&#xA;this License.&#xA;&#xA;  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent&#xA;infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),&#xA;conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot&#xA;distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you&#xA;may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent&#xA;license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by&#xA;all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then&#xA;the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to&#xA;refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.&#xA;&#xA;If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any&#xA;particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,&#xA;and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.&#xA;&#xA;It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any&#xA;patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any&#xA;such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the&#xA;integrity of the free software distribution system which is&#xA;implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made&#xA;generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed&#xA;through that system in reliance on consistent application of that&#xA;system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing&#xA;to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot&#xA;impose that choice.&#xA;&#xA;This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to&#xA;be a consequence of the rest of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in&#xA;certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the&#xA;original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add&#xA;an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,&#xA;so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus&#xA;excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if&#xA;written in the body of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new&#xA;versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.&#xA;Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,&#xA;but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.&#xA;&#xA;Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library&#xA;specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and&#xA;&quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and&#xA;conditions either of that version or of any later version published by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a&#xA;license version number, you may choose any version ever published by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation.&#xA;&#xA;  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free&#xA;programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,&#xA;write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is&#xA;copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free&#xA;Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our&#xA;decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status&#xA;of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing&#xA;and reuse of software generally.&#xA;&#xA;       NO WARRANTY&#xA;&#xA;  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO&#xA;WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.&#xA;EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR&#xA;OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY&#xA;KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE&#xA;IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#xA;PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE&#xA;LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME&#xA;THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;&#xA;  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN&#xA;WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY&#xA;AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU&#xA;FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR&#xA;CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE&#xA;LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING&#xA;RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A&#xA;FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF&#xA;SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH&#xA;DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;       END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;&#xA;           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries&#xA;&#xA;  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest&#xA;possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that&#xA;everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting&#xA;redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the&#xA;ordinary General Public License).&#xA;&#xA;  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is&#xA;safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively&#xA;convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the&#xA;&quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.&#xA;&#xA;    &lt;one line to give the library&apos;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;&#xA;    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;&#xA;&#xA;    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or&#xA;    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either&#xA;    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.&#xA;&#xA;    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,&#xA;    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of&#xA;    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU&#xA;    Lesser General Public License for more details.&#xA;&#xA;    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software&#xA;    Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA&#xA;&#xA;Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.&#xA;&#xA;You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your&#xA;school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the library, if&#xA;necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:&#xA;&#xA;  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the&#xA;  library `Frob&apos; (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.&#xA;&#xA;  &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1990&#xA;  Ty Coon, President of Vice&#xA;&#xA;That&apos;s all there is to it!

          GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;Version 2.1, February 1999&#xA;Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.&#xA;59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA&#xA;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies&#xA;of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.&#xA;[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also&#xA;counts&#xA;as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2,&#xA;hence&#xA;the version number 2.1.]&#xA;Preamble&#xA;The licenses for most software are designed to take away your&#xA;freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General&#xA;Public&#xA;Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and&#xA;change&#xA;free software--to make sure the software is free for all its&#xA;users.&#xA;This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some&#xA;specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of&#xA;the&#xA;Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use&#xA;it.  You&#xA;can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about&#xA;whether&#xA;this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better&#xA;strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations&#xA;below.&#xA;When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of&#xA;use,&#xA;not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make&#xA;sure that&#xA;you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and&#xA;charge&#xA;for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or&#xA;can get&#xA;it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces&#xA;of&#xA;it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can&#xA;do&#xA;these things.&#xA;To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid&#xA;distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender&#xA;these&#xA;rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities&#xA;for&#xA;you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify&#xA;it.&#xA;For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether&#xA;gratis&#xA;or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that&#xA;we gave&#xA;you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the&#xA;source&#xA;code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide&#xA;complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink&#xA;them&#xA;with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling&#xA;it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.&#xA;We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright&#xA;the&#xA;library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal&#xA;permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.&#xA;To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that&#xA;there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library&#xA;is&#xA;modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should&#xA;know&#xA;that what they have is not the original version, so that the&#xA;original&#xA;author&apos;s reputation will not be affected by problems that might&#xA;be&#xA;introduced by others.&#xA;Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence&#xA;of&#xA;any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot&#xA;effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining&#xA;a&#xA;restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist&#xA;that&#xA;any patent license obtained for a version of the library must&#xA;be&#xA;consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.&#xA;Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the&#xA;ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser&#xA;General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries,&#xA;and&#xA;is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.&#xA;We use&#xA;this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking&#xA;those&#xA;libraries into non-free programs.&#xA;When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or&#xA;using&#xA;a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking&#xA;a&#xA;combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary&#xA;General Public License therefore permits such linking only if&#xA;the&#xA;entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser&#xA;General&#xA;Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code&#xA;with&#xA;the library.&#xA;We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because&#xA;it&#xA;does Less to protect the user&apos;s freedom than the ordinary General&#xA;Public License.  It also provides other free software developers&#xA;Less&#xA;of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages&#xA;are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for&#xA;many&#xA;libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in&#xA;certain&#xA;special circumstances.&#xA;For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to&#xA;encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that&#xA;it becomes&#xA;a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must&#xA;be&#xA;allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free&#xA;library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.&#xA;In this&#xA;case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to&#xA;free&#xA;software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.&#xA;In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free&#xA;programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body&#xA;of&#xA;free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library&#xA;in&#xA;non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU&#xA;operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating&#xA;system.&#xA;Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective&#xA;of the&#xA;users&apos; freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that&#xA;is&#xA;linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to&#xA;run&#xA;that program using a modified version of the Library.&#xA;The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between&#xA;a&#xA;&quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;.&#xA;The&#xA;former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter&#xA;must&#xA;be combined with the library in order to run.&#xA;GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION&#xA;0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or&#xA;other&#xA;program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder&#xA;or&#xA;other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the&#xA;terms of&#xA;this Lesser General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;).&#xA;Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.&#xA;A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data&#xA;prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs&#xA;(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.&#xA;The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or&#xA;work&#xA;which has been distributed under these terms.  A &quot;work based&#xA;on the&#xA;Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under&#xA;copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library&#xA;or a&#xA;portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated&#xA;straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation&#xA;is&#xA;included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)&#xA;&quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work&#xA;for&#xA;making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code&#xA;means&#xA;all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated&#xA;interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control&#xA;compilation&#xA;and installation of the library.&#xA;Activities other than copying, distribution and modification&#xA;are not&#xA;covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act&#xA;of&#xA;running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output&#xA;from&#xA;such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work&#xA;based&#xA;on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool&#xA;for&#xA;writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library&#xA;does&#xA;and what the program that uses the Library does.&#xA;1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library&apos;s&#xA;complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided&#xA;that&#xA;you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an&#xA;appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep&#xA;intact&#xA;all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence&#xA;of any&#xA;warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the&#xA;Library.&#xA;You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,&#xA;and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange&#xA;for a&#xA;fee.&#xA;2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion&#xA;of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and&#xA;distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section&#xA;1&#xA;above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;a) The modified work must itself be a software library.&#xA;b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices&#xA;stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.&#xA;c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no&#xA;charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.&#xA;d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function&#xA;or a&#xA;table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses&#xA;the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility&#xA;is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure&#xA;that,&#xA;in the event an application does not supply such function or&#xA;table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part&#xA;of&#xA;its purpose remains meaningful.&#xA;(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots&#xA;has&#xA;a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the&#xA;application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any&#xA;application-supplied function or table used by this function&#xA;must&#xA;be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square&#xA;root function must still compute square roots.)&#xA;These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If&#xA;identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,&#xA;and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works&#xA;in&#xA;themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to&#xA;those&#xA;sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when&#xA;you&#xA;distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work&#xA;based&#xA;on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the&#xA;terms of&#xA;this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to&#xA;the&#xA;entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who&#xA;wrote&#xA;it.&#xA;Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or&#xA;contest&#xA;your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent&#xA;is to&#xA;exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative&#xA;or&#xA;collective works based on the Library.&#xA;In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the&#xA;Library&#xA;with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume&#xA;of&#xA;a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work&#xA;under&#xA;the scope of this License.&#xA;3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General&#xA;Public&#xA;License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.&#xA;To do&#xA;this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License,&#xA;so&#xA;that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version&#xA;2,&#xA;instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version&#xA;2 of the&#xA;ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can&#xA;specify&#xA;that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change&#xA;in&#xA;these notices.&#xA;Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible&#xA;for&#xA;that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies&#xA;to all&#xA;subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.&#xA;This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code&#xA;of&#xA;the Library into a program that is not a library.&#xA;4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or&#xA;derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable&#xA;form&#xA;under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany&#xA;it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code,&#xA;which&#xA;must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above&#xA;on a&#xA;medium customarily used for software interchange.&#xA;If distribution of object code is made by offering access to&#xA;copy&#xA;from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy&#xA;the&#xA;source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to&#xA;distribute the source code, even though third parties are not&#xA;compelled to copy the source along with the object code.&#xA;5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the&#xA;Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled&#xA;or&#xA;linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;.  Such&#xA;a&#xA;work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library,&#xA;and&#xA;therefore falls outside the scope of this License.&#xA;However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library&#xA;creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because&#xA;it&#xA;contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses&#xA;the&#xA;library&quot;.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.&#xA;Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.&#xA;When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header&#xA;file&#xA;that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may&#xA;be a&#xA;derivative work of the Library even though the source code is&#xA;not.&#xA;Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can&#xA;be&#xA;linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.&#xA;The&#xA;threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.&#xA;If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data&#xA;structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline&#xA;functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the&#xA;object&#xA;file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative&#xA;work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions&#xA;of the&#xA;Library will still fall under Section 6.)&#xA;Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may&#xA;distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section&#xA;6.&#xA;Any executables containing that work also fall under Section&#xA;6,&#xA;whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.&#xA;6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine&#xA;or&#xA;link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce&#xA;a&#xA;work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that&#xA;work&#xA;under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit&#xA;modification of the work for the customer&apos;s own use and reverse&#xA;engineering for debugging such modifications.&#xA;You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that&#xA;the&#xA;Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered&#xA;by&#xA;this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the&#xA;work&#xA;during execution displays copyright notices, you must include&#xA;the&#xA;copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference&#xA;directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must&#xA;do one&#xA;of these things:&#xA;a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding&#xA;machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever&#xA;changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under&#xA;Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked&#xA;with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that&#xA;uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that&#xA;the&#xA;user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified&#xA;executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood&#xA;that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in&#xA;the&#xA;Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application&#xA;to use the modified definitions.)&#xA;b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the&#xA;Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time&#xA;a&#xA;copy of the library already present on the user&apos;s computer system,&#xA;rather than copying library functions into the executable, and&#xA;(2)&#xA;will operate properly with a modified version of the library,&#xA;if&#xA;the user installs one, as long as the modified version is&#xA;interface-compatible with the version that the work was made&#xA;with.&#xA;c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at&#xA;least three years, to give the same user the materials&#xA;specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more&#xA;than the cost of performing this distribution.&#xA;d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to&#xA;copy&#xA;from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the&#xA;above&#xA;specified materials from the same place.&#xA;e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these&#xA;materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.&#xA;For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the&#xA;Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for&#xA;reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,&#xA;the materials to be distributed need not include anything that&#xA;is&#xA;normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the&#xA;major&#xA;components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system&#xA;on&#xA;which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies&#xA;the executable.&#xA;It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license&#xA;restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally&#xA;accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you&#xA;cannot&#xA;use both them and the Library together in an executable that&#xA;you&#xA;distribute.&#xA;7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on&#xA;the&#xA;Library side-by-side in a single library together with other&#xA;library&#xA;facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a&#xA;combined&#xA;library, provided that the separate distribution of the work&#xA;based on&#xA;the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise&#xA;permitted, and provided that you do these two things:&#xA;a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work&#xA;based on the Library, uncombined with any other library&#xA;facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the&#xA;Sections above.&#xA;b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact&#xA;that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining&#xA;where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.&#xA;8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute&#xA;the Library except as expressly provided under this License.&#xA;Any&#xA;attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or&#xA;distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate&#xA;your&#xA;rights under this License.  However, parties who have received&#xA;copies,&#xA;or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses&#xA;terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.&#xA;9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have&#xA;not&#xA;signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify&#xA;or&#xA;distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions&#xA;are&#xA;prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore,&#xA;by&#xA;modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the&#xA;Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do&#xA;so, and&#xA;all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying&#xA;the Library or works based on it.&#xA;10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based&#xA;on the&#xA;Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from&#xA;the&#xA;original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the&#xA;Library&#xA;subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any&#xA;further&#xA;restrictions on the recipients&apos; exercise of the rights granted&#xA;herein.&#xA;You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties&#xA;with&#xA;this License.&#xA;11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of&#xA;patent&#xA;infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),&#xA;conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement&#xA;or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they&#xA;do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot&#xA;distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under&#xA;this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence&#xA;you&#xA;may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent&#xA;license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library&#xA;by&#xA;all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you,&#xA;then&#xA;the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would&#xA;be to&#xA;refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.&#xA;If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable&#xA;under any&#xA;particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended&#xA;to apply,&#xA;and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.&#xA;It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe&#xA;any&#xA;patents or other property right claims or to contest validity&#xA;of any&#xA;such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting&#xA;the&#xA;integrity of the free software distribution system which is&#xA;implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made&#xA;generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed&#xA;through that system in reliance on consistent application of&#xA;that&#xA;system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is&#xA;willing&#xA;to distribute software through any other system and a licensee&#xA;cannot&#xA;impose that choice.&#xA;This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed&#xA;to&#xA;be a consequence of the rest of this License.&#xA;12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted&#xA;in&#xA;certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,&#xA;the&#xA;original copyright holder who places the Library under this License&#xA;may add&#xA;an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those&#xA;countries,&#xA;so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries&#xA;not thus&#xA;excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation&#xA;as if&#xA;written in the body of this License.&#xA;13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new&#xA;versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.&#xA;Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,&#xA;but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.&#xA;Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&#xA;Library&#xA;specifies a version number of this License which applies to it&#xA;and&#xA;&quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms&#xA;and&#xA;conditions either of that version or of any later version published&#xA;by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify&#xA;a&#xA;license version number, you may choose any version ever published&#xA;by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation.&#xA;14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other&#xA;free&#xA;programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with&#xA;these,&#xA;write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which&#xA;is&#xA;copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free&#xA;Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. &#xA;Our&#xA;decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free&#xA;status&#xA;of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the&#xA;sharing&#xA;and reuse of software generally.&#xA;NO WARRANTY&#xA;15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS&#xA;NO&#xA;WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE&#xA;LAW.&#xA;EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS&#xA;AND/OR&#xA;OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF&#xA;ANY&#xA;KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED&#xA;TO, THE&#xA;IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#xA;PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF&#xA;THE&#xA;LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU&#xA;ASSUME&#xA;THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO&#xA;IN&#xA;WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY&#xA;MODIFY&#xA;AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE&#xA;TO YOU&#xA;FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR&#xA;CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO&#xA;USE THE&#xA;LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING&#xA;RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES&#xA;OR A&#xA;FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN&#xA;IF&#xA;SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY&#xA;OF SUCH&#xA;DAMAGES.&#xA;END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries&#xA;If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest&#xA;possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software&#xA;that&#xA;everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting&#xA;redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the&#xA;terms of the&#xA;ordinary General Public License).&#xA;To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.&#xA;It is&#xA;safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most&#xA;effectively&#xA;convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at&#xA;least the&#xA;&quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.&#xA;&lt;one line to give the library&apos;s name and a brief idea of what&#xA;it does.&gt;&#xA;Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;&#xA;This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or&#xA;modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either&#xA;version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.&#xA;This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,&#xA;but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of&#xA;MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

          GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;Version 2.1, February 1999&#xA;Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.&#xA;59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA&#xA;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies&#xA;of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.&#xA;[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also&#xA;counts&#xA;as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2,&#xA;hence&#xA;the version number 2.1.]&#xA;Preamble&#xA;The licenses for most software are designed to take away your&#xA;freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General&#xA;Public&#xA;Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and&#xA;change&#xA;free software--to make sure the software is free for all its&#xA;users.&#xA;This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some&#xA;specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of&#xA;the&#xA;Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use&#xA;it.  You&#xA;can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about&#xA;whether&#xA;this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better&#xA;strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations&#xA;below.&#xA;When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of&#xA;use,&#xA;not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make&#xA;sure that&#xA;you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and&#xA;charge&#xA;for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or&#xA;can get&#xA;it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces&#xA;of&#xA;it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can&#xA;do&#xA;these things.&#xA;To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid&#xA;distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender&#xA;these&#xA;rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities&#xA;for&#xA;you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify&#xA;it.&#xA;For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether&#xA;gratis&#xA;or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that&#xA;we gave&#xA;you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the&#xA;source&#xA;code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide&#xA;complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink&#xA;them&#xA;with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling&#xA;it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.&#xA;We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright&#xA;the&#xA;library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal&#xA;permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.&#xA;To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that&#xA;there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library&#xA;is&#xA;modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should&#xA;know&#xA;that what they have is not the original version, so that the&#xA;original&#xA;author&apos;s reputation will not be affected by problems that might&#xA;be&#xA;introduced by others.&#xA;Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence&#xA;of&#xA;any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot&#xA;effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining&#xA;a&#xA;restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist&#xA;that&#xA;any patent license obtained for a version of the library must&#xA;be&#xA;consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.&#xA;Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the&#xA;ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser&#xA;General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries,&#xA;and&#xA;is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.&#xA;We use&#xA;this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking&#xA;those&#xA;libraries into non-free programs.&#xA;When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or&#xA;using&#xA;a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking&#xA;a&#xA;combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary&#xA;General Public License therefore permits such linking only if&#xA;the&#xA;entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser&#xA;General&#xA;Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code&#xA;with&#xA;the library.&#xA;We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because&#xA;it&#xA;does Less to protect the user&apos;s freedom than the ordinary General&#xA;Public License.  It also provides other free software developers&#xA;Less&#xA;of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages&#xA;are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for&#xA;many&#xA;libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in&#xA;certain&#xA;special circumstances.&#xA;For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to&#xA;encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that&#xA;it becomes&#xA;a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must&#xA;be&#xA;allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free&#xA;library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.&#xA;In this&#xA;case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to&#xA;free&#xA;software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.&#xA;In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free&#xA;programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body&#xA;of&#xA;free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library&#xA;in&#xA;non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU&#xA;operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating&#xA;system.&#xA;Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective&#xA;of the&#xA;users&apos; freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that&#xA;is&#xA;linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to&#xA;run&#xA;that program using a modified version of the Library.&#xA;The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between&#xA;a&#xA;&quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;.&#xA;The&#xA;former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter&#xA;must&#xA;be combined with the library in order to run.&#xA;GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION&#xA;0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or&#xA;other&#xA;program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder&#xA;or&#xA;other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the&#xA;terms of&#xA;this Lesser General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;).&#xA;Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.&#xA;A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data&#xA;prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs&#xA;(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.&#xA;The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or&#xA;work&#xA;which has been distributed under these terms.  A &quot;work based&#xA;on the&#xA;Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under&#xA;copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library&#xA;or a&#xA;portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated&#xA;straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation&#xA;is&#xA;included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)&#xA;&quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work&#xA;for&#xA;making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code&#xA;means&#xA;all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated&#xA;interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control&#xA;compilation&#xA;and installation of the library.&#xA;Activities other than copying, distribution and modification&#xA;are not&#xA;covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act&#xA;of&#xA;running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output&#xA;from&#xA;such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work&#xA;based&#xA;on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool&#xA;for&#xA;writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library&#xA;does&#xA;and what the program that uses the Library does.&#xA;1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library&apos;s&#xA;complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided&#xA;that&#xA;you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an&#xA;appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep&#xA;intact&#xA;all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence&#xA;of any&#xA;warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the&#xA;Library.&#xA;You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,&#xA;and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange&#xA;for a&#xA;fee.&#xA;2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion&#xA;of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and&#xA;distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section&#xA;1&#xA;above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;a) The modified work must itself be a software library.&#xA;b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices&#xA;stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.&#xA;c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no&#xA;charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.&#xA;d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function&#xA;or a&#xA;table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses&#xA;the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility&#xA;is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure&#xA;that,&#xA;in the event an application does not supply such function or&#xA;table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part&#xA;of&#xA;its purpose remains meaningful.&#xA;(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots&#xA;has&#xA;a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the&#xA;application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any&#xA;application-supplied function or table used by this function&#xA;must&#xA;be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square&#xA;root function must still compute square roots.)&#xA;These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If&#xA;identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,&#xA;and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works&#xA;in&#xA;themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to&#xA;those&#xA;sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when&#xA;you&#xA;distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work&#xA;based&#xA;on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the&#xA;terms of&#xA;this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to&#xA;the&#xA;entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who&#xA;wrote&#xA;it.&#xA;Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or&#xA;contest&#xA;your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent&#xA;is to&#xA;exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative&#xA;or&#xA;collective works based on the Library.&#xA;In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the&#xA;Library&#xA;with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume&#xA;of&#xA;a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work&#xA;under&#xA;the scope of this License.&#xA;3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General&#xA;Public&#xA;License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.&#xA;To do&#xA;this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License,&#xA;so&#xA;that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version&#xA;2,&#xA;instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version&#xA;2 of the&#xA;ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can&#xA;specify&#xA;that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change&#xA;in&#xA;these notices.&#xA;Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible&#xA;for&#xA;that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies&#xA;to all&#xA;subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.&#xA;This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code&#xA;of&#xA;the Library into a program that is not a library.&#xA;4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or&#xA;derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable&#xA;form&#xA;under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany&#xA;it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code,&#xA;which&#xA;must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above&#xA;on a&#xA;medium customarily used for software interchange.&#xA;If distribution of object code is made by offering access to&#xA;copy&#xA;from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy&#xA;the&#xA;source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to&#xA;distribute the source code, even though third parties are not&#xA;compelled to copy the source along with the object code.&#xA;5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the&#xA;Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled&#xA;or&#xA;linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;.  Such&#xA;a&#xA;work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library,&#xA;and&#xA;therefore falls outside the scope of this License.&#xA;However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library&#xA;creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because&#xA;it&#xA;contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses&#xA;the&#xA;library&quot;.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.&#xA;Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.&#xA;When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header&#xA;file&#xA;that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may&#xA;be a&#xA;derivative work of the Library even though the source code is&#xA;not.&#xA;Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can&#xA;be&#xA;linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.&#xA;The&#xA;threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.&#xA;If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data&#xA;structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline&#xA;functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the&#xA;object&#xA;file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative&#xA;work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions&#xA;of the&#xA;Library will still fall under Section 6.)&#xA;Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may&#xA;distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section&#xA;6.&#xA;Any executables containing that work also fall under Section&#xA;6,&#xA;whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.&#xA;6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine&#xA;or&#xA;link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce&#xA;a&#xA;work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that&#xA;work&#xA;under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit&#xA;modification of the work for the customer&apos;s own use and reverse&#xA;engineering for debugging such modifications.&#xA;You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that&#xA;the&#xA;Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered&#xA;by&#xA;this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the&#xA;work&#xA;during execution displays copyright notices, you must include&#xA;the&#xA;copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference&#xA;directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must&#xA;do one&#xA;of these things:&#xA;a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding&#xA;machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever&#xA;changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under&#xA;Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked&#xA;with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that&#xA;uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that&#xA;the&#xA;user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified&#xA;executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood&#xA;that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in&#xA;the&#xA;Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application&#xA;to use the modified definitions.)&#xA;b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the&#xA;Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time&#xA;a&#xA;copy of the library already present on the user&apos;s computer system,&#xA;rather than copying library functions into the executable, and&#xA;(2)&#xA;will operate properly with a modified version of the library,&#xA;if&#xA;the user installs one, as long as the modified version is&#xA;interface-compatible with the version that the work was made&#xA;with.&#xA;c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at&#xA;least three years, to give the same user the materials&#xA;specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more&#xA;than the cost of performing this distribution.&#xA;d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to&#xA;copy&#xA;from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the&#xA;above&#xA;specified materials from the same place.&#xA;e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these&#xA;materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.&#xA;For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the&#xA;Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for&#xA;reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,&#xA;the materials to be distributed need not include anything that&#xA;is&#xA;normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the&#xA;major&#xA;components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system&#xA;on&#xA;which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies&#xA;the executable.&#xA;It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license&#xA;restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally&#xA;accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you&#xA;cannot&#xA;use both them and the Library together in an executable that&#xA;you&#xA;distribute.&#xA;7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on&#xA;the&#xA;Library side-by-side in a single library together with other&#xA;library&#xA;facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a&#xA;combined&#xA;library, provided that the separate distribution of the work&#xA;based on&#xA;the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise&#xA;permitted, and provided that you do these two things:&#xA;a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work&#xA;based on the Library, uncombined with any other library&#xA;facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the&#xA;Sections above.&#xA;b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact&#xA;that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining&#xA;where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.&#xA;8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute&#xA;the Library except as expressly provided under this License.&#xA;Any&#xA;attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or&#xA;distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate&#xA;your&#xA;rights under this License.  However, parties who have received&#xA;copies,&#xA;or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses&#xA;terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.&#xA;9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have&#xA;not&#xA;signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify&#xA;or&#xA;distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions&#xA;are&#xA;prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore,&#xA;by&#xA;modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the&#xA;Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do&#xA;so, and&#xA;all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying&#xA;the Library or works based on it.&#xA;10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based&#xA;on the&#xA;Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from&#xA;the&#xA;original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the&#xA;Library&#xA;subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any&#xA;further&#xA;restrictions on the recipients&apos; exercise of the rights granted&#xA;herein.&#xA;You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties&#xA;with&#xA;this License.&#xA;11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of&#xA;patent&#xA;infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),&#xA;conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement&#xA;or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they&#xA;do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot&#xA;distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under&#xA;this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence&#xA;you&#xA;may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent&#xA;license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library&#xA;by&#xA;all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you,&#xA;then&#xA;the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would&#xA;be to&#xA;refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.&#xA;If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable&#xA;under any&#xA;particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended&#xA;to apply,&#xA;and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.&#xA;It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe&#xA;any&#xA;patents or other property right claims or to contest validity&#xA;of any&#xA;such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting&#xA;the&#xA;integrity of the free software distribution system which is&#xA;implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made&#xA;generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed&#xA;through that system in reliance on consistent application of&#xA;that&#xA;system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is&#xA;willing&#xA;to distribute software through any other system and a licensee&#xA;cannot&#xA;impose that choice.&#xA;This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed&#xA;to&#xA;be a consequence of the rest of this License.&#xA;12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted&#xA;in&#xA;certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,&#xA;the&#xA;original copyright holder who places the Library under this License&#xA;may add&#xA;an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those&#xA;countries,&#xA;so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries&#xA;not thus&#xA;excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation&#xA;as if&#xA;written in the body of this License.&#xA;13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new&#xA;versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.&#xA;Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,&#xA;but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.&#xA;Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&#xA;Library&#xA;specifies a version number of this License which applies to it&#xA;and&#xA;&quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms&#xA;and&#xA;conditions either of that version or of any later version published&#xA;by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify&#xA;a&#xA;license version number, you may choose any version ever published&#xA;by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation.&#xA;14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other&#xA;free&#xA;programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with&#xA;these,&#xA;write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which&#xA;is&#xA;copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free&#xA;Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. &#xA;Our&#xA;decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free&#xA;status&#xA;of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the&#xA;sharing&#xA;and reuse of software generally.&#xA;NO WARRANTY&#xA;15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS&#xA;NO&#xA;WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE&#xA;LAW.&#xA;EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS&#xA;AND/OR&#xA;OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF&#xA;ANY&#xA;KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED&#xA;TO, THE&#xA;IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#xA;PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF&#xA;THE&#xA;LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU&#xA;ASSUME&#xA;THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO&#xA;IN&#xA;WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY&#xA;MODIFY&#xA;AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE&#xA;TO YOU&#xA;FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR&#xA;CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO&#xA;USE THE&#xA;LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING&#xA;RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES&#xA;OR A&#xA;FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN&#xA;IF&#xA;SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY&#xA;OF SUCH&#xA;DAMAGES.&#xA;END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries&#xA;If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest&#xA;possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software&#xA;that&#xA;everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting&#xA;redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the&#xA;terms of the&#xA;ordinary General Public License).&#xA;To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.&#xA;It is&#xA;safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most&#xA;effectively&#xA;convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at&#xA;least the&#xA;&quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.&#xA;&lt;one line to give the library&apos;s name and a brief idea of what&#xA;it does.&gt;&#xA;Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;&#xA;This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or&#xA;modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either&#xA;version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.&#xA;This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,&#xA;but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of&#xA;MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the&#xA;GNU&#xA;Lesser General Public License for more details.&#xA;You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software&#xA;Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307&#xA;USA&#xA;Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and&#xA;paper mail.&#xA;You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer)&#xA;or your&#xA;school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the library,&#xA;if&#xA;necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:&#xA;Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the&#xA;library `Frob&apos; (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James&#xA;Random Hacker.&#xA;&lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1990&#xA;Ty Coon, President of Vice&#xA;That&apos;s all there is to it!

          GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;Version 2.1, February 1999&#xA;Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.&#xA;59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA&#xA;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies&#xA;of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.&#xA;[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also&#xA;counts&#xA;as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2,&#xA;hence&#xA;the version number 2.1.]&#xA;Preamble&#xA;The licenses for most software are designed to take away your&#xA;freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General&#xA;Public&#xA;Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and&#xA;change&#xA;free software--to make sure the software is free for all its&#xA;users.&#xA;This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some&#xA;specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of&#xA;the&#xA;Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use&#xA;it.  You&#xA;can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about&#xA;whether&#xA;this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better&#xA;strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations&#xA;below.&#xA;When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of&#xA;use,&#xA;not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make&#xA;sure that&#xA;you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and&#xA;charge&#xA;for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or&#xA;can get&#xA;it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces&#xA;of&#xA;it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can&#xA;do&#xA;these things.&#xA;To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid&#xA;distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender&#xA;these&#xA;rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities&#xA;for&#xA;you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify&#xA;it.&#xA;For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether&#xA;gratis&#xA;or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that&#xA;we gave&#xA;you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the&#xA;source&#xA;code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide&#xA;complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink&#xA;them&#xA;with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling&#xA;it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.&#xA;We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright&#xA;the&#xA;library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal&#xA;permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.&#xA;To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that&#xA;there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library&#xA;is&#xA;modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should&#xA;know&#xA;that what they have is not the original version, so that the&#xA;original&#xA;author&apos;s reputation will not be affected by problems that might&#xA;be&#xA;introduced by others.&#xA;Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence&#xA;of&#xA;any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot&#xA;effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining&#xA;a&#xA;restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist&#xA;that&#xA;any patent license obtained for a version of the library must&#xA;be&#xA;consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.&#xA;Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the&#xA;ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser&#xA;General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries,&#xA;and&#xA;is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.&#xA;We use&#xA;this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking&#xA;those&#xA;libraries into non-free programs.&#xA;When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or&#xA;using&#xA;a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking&#xA;a&#xA;combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary&#xA;General Public License therefore permits such linking only if&#xA;the&#xA;entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser&#xA;General&#xA;Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code&#xA;with&#xA;the library.&#xA;We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because&#xA;it&#xA;does Less to protect the user&apos;s freedom than the ordinary General&#xA;Public License.  It also provides other free software developers&#xA;Less&#xA;of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages&#xA;are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for&#xA;many&#xA;libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in&#xA;certain&#xA;special circumstances.&#xA;For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to&#xA;encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that&#xA;it becomes&#xA;a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must&#xA;be&#xA;allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free&#xA;library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.&#xA;In this&#xA;case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to&#xA;free&#xA;software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.&#xA;In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free&#xA;programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body&#xA;of&#xA;free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library&#xA;in&#xA;non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU&#xA;operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating&#xA;system.&#xA;Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective&#xA;of the&#xA;users&apos; freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that&#xA;is&#xA;linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to&#xA;run&#xA;that program using a modified version of the Library.&#xA;The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between&#xA;a&#xA;&quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;.&#xA;The&#xA;former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter&#xA;must&#xA;be combined with the library in order to run.&#xA;GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION&#xA;0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or&#xA;other&#xA;program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder&#xA;or&#xA;other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the&#xA;terms of&#xA;this Lesser General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;).&#xA;Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.&#xA;A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data&#xA;prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs&#xA;(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.&#xA;The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or&#xA;work&#xA;which has been distributed under these terms.  A &quot;work based&#xA;on the&#xA;Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under&#xA;copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library&#xA;or a&#xA;portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated&#xA;straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation&#xA;is&#xA;included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)&#xA;&quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work&#xA;for&#xA;making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code&#xA;means&#xA;all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated&#xA;interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control&#xA;compilation&#xA;and installation of the library.&#xA;Activities other than copying, distribution and modification&#xA;are not&#xA;covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act&#xA;of&#xA;running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output&#xA;from&#xA;such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work&#xA;based&#xA;on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool&#xA;for&#xA;writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library&#xA;does&#xA;and what the program that uses the Library does.&#xA;1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library&apos;s&#xA;complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided&#xA;that&#xA;you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an&#xA;appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep&#xA;intact&#xA;all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence&#xA;of any&#xA;warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the&#xA;Library.&#xA;You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,&#xA;and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange&#xA;for a&#xA;fee.&#xA;2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion&#xA;of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and&#xA;distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section&#xA;1&#xA;above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;a) The modified work must itself be a software library.&#xA;b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices&#xA;stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.&#xA;c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no&#xA;charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.&#xA;d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function&#xA;or a&#xA;table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses&#xA;the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility&#xA;is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure&#xA;that,&#xA;in the event an application does not supply such function or&#xA;table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part&#xA;of&#xA;its purpose remains meaningful.&#xA;(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots&#xA;has&#xA;a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the&#xA;application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any&#xA;application-supplied function or table used by this function&#xA;must&#xA;be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square&#xA;root function must still compute square roots.)&#xA;These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If&#xA;identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,&#xA;and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works&#xA;in&#xA;themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to&#xA;those&#xA;sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when&#xA;you&#xA;distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work&#xA;based&#xA;on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the&#xA;terms of&#xA;this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to&#xA;the&#xA;entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who&#xA;wrote&#xA;it.&#xA;Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or&#xA;contest&#xA;your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent&#xA;is to&#xA;exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative&#xA;or&#xA;collective works based on the Library.&#xA;In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the&#xA;Library&#xA;with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume&#xA;of&#xA;a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work&#xA;under&#xA;the scope of this License.&#xA;3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General&#xA;Public&#xA;License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.&#xA;To do&#xA;this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License,&#xA;so&#xA;that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version&#xA;2,&#xA;instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version&#xA;2 of the&#xA;ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can&#xA;specify&#xA;that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change&#xA;in&#xA;these notices.&#xA;Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible&#xA;for&#xA;that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies&#xA;to all&#xA;subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.&#xA;This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code&#xA;of&#xA;the Library into a program that is not a library.&#xA;4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or&#xA;derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable&#xA;form&#xA;under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany&#xA;it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code,&#xA;which&#xA;must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above&#xA;on a&#xA;medium customarily used for software interchange.&#xA;If distribution of object code is made by offering access to&#xA;copy&#xA;from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy&#xA;the&#xA;source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to&#xA;distribute the source code, even though third parties are not&#xA;compelled to copy the source along with the object code.&#xA;5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the&#xA;Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled&#xA;or&#xA;linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;.  Such&#xA;a&#xA;work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library,&#xA;and&#xA;therefore falls outside the scope of this License.&#xA;However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library&#xA;creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because&#xA;it&#xA;contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses&#xA;the&#xA;library&quot;.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.&#xA;Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.&#xA;When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header&#xA;file&#xA;that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may&#xA;be a&#xA;derivative work of the Library even though the source code is&#xA;not.&#xA;Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can&#xA;be&#xA;linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.&#xA;The&#xA;threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.&#xA;If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data&#xA;structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline&#xA;functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the&#xA;object&#xA;file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative&#xA;work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions&#xA;of the&#xA;Library will still fall under Section 6.)&#xA;Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may&#xA;distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section&#xA;6.&#xA;Any executables containing that work also fall under Section&#xA;6,&#xA;whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.&#xA;6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine&#xA;or&#xA;link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce&#xA;a&#xA;work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that&#xA;work&#xA;under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit&#xA;modification of the work for the customer&apos;s own use and reverse&#xA;engineering for debugging such modifications.&#xA;You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that&#xA;the&#xA;Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered&#xA;by&#xA;this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the&#xA;work&#xA;during execution displays copyright notices, you must include&#xA;the&#xA;copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference&#xA;directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must&#xA;do one&#xA;of these things:&#xA;a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding&#xA;machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever&#xA;changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under&#xA;Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked&#xA;with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that&#xA;uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that&#xA;the&#xA;user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified&#xA;executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood&#xA;that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in&#xA;the&#xA;Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application&#xA;to use the modified definitions.)&#xA;b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the&#xA;Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time&#xA;a&#xA;copy of the library already present on the user&apos;s computer system,&#xA;rather than copying library functions into the executable, and&#xA;(2)&#xA;will operate properly with a modified version of the library,&#xA;if&#xA;the user installs one, as long as the modified version is&#xA;interface-compatible with the version that the work was made&#xA;with.&#xA;c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at&#xA;least three years, to give the same user the materials&#xA;specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more&#xA;than the cost of performing this distribution.&#xA;d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to&#xA;copy&#xA;from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the&#xA;above&#xA;specified materials from the same place.&#xA;e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these&#xA;materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.&#xA;For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the&#xA;Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for&#xA;reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,&#xA;the materials to be distributed need not include anything that&#xA;is&#xA;normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the&#xA;major&#xA;components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system&#xA;on&#xA;which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies&#xA;the executable.&#xA;It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license&#xA;restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally&#xA;accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you&#xA;cannot&#xA;use both them and the Library together in an executable that&#xA;you&#xA;distribute.&#xA;7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on&#xA;the&#xA;Library side-by-side in a single library together with other&#xA;library&#xA;facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a&#xA;combined&#xA;library, provided that the separate distribution of the work&#xA;based on&#xA;the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise&#xA;permitted, and provided that you do these two things:&#xA;a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work&#xA;based on the Library, uncombined with any other library&#xA;facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the&#xA;Sections above.&#xA;b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact&#xA;that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining&#xA;where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.&#xA;8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute&#xA;the Library except as expressly provided under this License.&#xA;Any&#xA;attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or&#xA;distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate&#xA;your&#xA;rights under this License.  However, parties who have received&#xA;copies,&#xA;or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses&#xA;terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.&#xA;9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have&#xA;not&#xA;signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify&#xA;or&#xA;distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions&#xA;are&#xA;prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore,&#xA;by&#xA;modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the&#xA;Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do&#xA;so, and&#xA;all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying&#xA;the Library or works based on it.&#xA;10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based&#xA;on the&#xA;Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from&#xA;the&#xA;original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the&#xA;Library&#xA;subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any&#xA;further&#xA;restrictions on the recipients&apos; exercise of the rights granted&#xA;herein.&#xA;You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties&#xA;with&#xA;this License.&#xA;11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of&#xA;patent&#xA;infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),&#xA;conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement&#xA;or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they&#xA;do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot&#xA;distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under&#xA;this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence&#xA;you&#xA;may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent&#xA;license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library&#xA;by&#xA;all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you,&#xA;then&#xA;the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would&#xA;be to&#xA;refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.&#xA;If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable&#xA;under any&#xA;particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended&#xA;to apply,&#xA;and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.&#xA;It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe&#xA;any&#xA;patents or other property right claims or to contest validity&#xA;of any&#xA;such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting&#xA;the&#xA;integrity of the free software distribution system which is&#xA;implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made&#xA;generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed&#xA;through that system in reliance on consistent application of&#xA;that&#xA;system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is&#xA;willing&#xA;to distribute software through any other system and a licensee&#xA;cannot&#xA;impose that choice.&#xA;This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed&#xA;to&#xA;be a consequence of the rest of this License.&#xA;12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted&#xA;in&#xA;certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,&#xA;the&#xA;original copyright holder who places the Library under this License&#xA;may add&#xA;an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those&#xA;countries,&#xA;so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries&#xA;not thus&#xA;excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation&#xA;as if&#xA;written in the body of this License.&#xA;13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new&#xA;versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.&#xA;Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,&#xA;but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.&#xA;Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&#xA;Library&#xA;specifies a version number of this License which applies to it&#xA;and&#xA;&quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms&#xA;and&#xA;conditions either of that version or of any later version published&#xA;by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify&#xA;a&#xA;license version number, you may choose any version ever published&#xA;by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation.&#xA;14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other&#xA;free&#xA;programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with&#xA;these,&#xA;write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which&#xA;is&#xA;copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free&#xA;Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. &#xA;Our&#xA;decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free&#xA;status&#xA;of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the&#xA;sharing&#xA;and reuse of software generally.&#xA;NO WARRANTY&#xA;15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS&#xA;NO&#xA;WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE&#xA;LAW.&#xA;EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS&#xA;AND/OR&#xA;OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF&#xA;ANY&#xA;KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED&#xA;TO, THE&#xA;IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#xA;PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF&#xA;THE&#xA;LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU&#xA;ASSUME&#xA;THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO&#xA;IN&#xA;WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY&#xA;MODIFY&#xA;AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE&#xA;TO YOU&#xA;FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR&#xA;CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO&#xA;USE THE&#xA;LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING&#xA;RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES&#xA;OR A&#xA;FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN&#xA;IF&#xA;SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY&#xA;OF SUCH&#xA;DAMAGES.&#xA;END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries&#xA;If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest&#xA;possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software&#xA;that&#xA;everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting&#xA;redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the&#xA;terms of the&#xA;ordinary General Public License).&#xA;To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.&#xA;It is&#xA;safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most&#xA;effectively&#xA;convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at&#xA;least the&#xA;&quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.&#xA;&lt;one line to give the library&apos;s name and a brief idea of what&#xA;it does.&gt;&#xA;Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;&#xA;This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or&#xA;modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either&#xA;version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.&#xA;This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,&#xA;but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of&#xA;MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the&#xA;GNU&#xA;Lesser General Public License for more details.&#xA;You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software&#xA;Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307&#xA;USA&#xA;Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and&#xA;paper mail.&#xA;You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer)&#xA;or your&#xA;school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the library,&#xA;if&#xA;necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:&#xA;Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the&#xA;library `Frob&apos; (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James&#xA;Random Hacker.&#xA;&lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1990&#xA;Ty Coon, President of Vice&#xA;That&apos;s all there is to it!

          GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;         Version 2.1, February 1999&#xA;&#xA; Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.&#xA;     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA&#xA; Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies&#xA; of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.&#xA;&#xA;[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts&#xA; as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence&#xA; the version number 2.1.]&#xA;&#xA;       Preamble&#xA;&#xA;  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your&#xA;freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public&#xA;Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change&#xA;free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.&#xA;&#xA;  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some&#xA;specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the&#xA;Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You&#xA;can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether&#xA;this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better&#xA;strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.&#xA;&#xA;  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,&#xA;not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that&#xA;you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge&#xA;for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get&#xA;it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of&#xA;it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do&#xA;these things.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid&#xA;distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these&#xA;rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for&#xA;you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis&#xA;or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave&#xA;you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source&#xA;code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide&#xA;complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them&#xA;with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling&#xA;it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.&#xA;&#xA;  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the&#xA;library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal&#xA;permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that&#xA;there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is&#xA;modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know&#xA;that what they have is not the original version, so that the original&#xA;author&apos;s reputation will not be affected by problems that might be&#xA;introduced by others.&#xA;&#xA;  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of&#xA;any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot&#xA;effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a&#xA;restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that&#xA;any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be&#xA;consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.&#xA;&#xA;  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the&#xA;ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser&#xA;General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and&#xA;is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use&#xA;this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those&#xA;libraries into non-free programs.&#xA;&#xA;  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using&#xA;a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a&#xA;combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary&#xA;General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the&#xA;entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General&#xA;Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with&#xA;the library.&#xA;&#xA;  We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because it&#xA;does Less to protect the user&apos;s freedom than the ordinary General&#xA;Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less&#xA;of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages&#xA;are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many&#xA;libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain&#xA;special circumstances.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to&#xA;encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes&#xA;a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be&#xA;allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free&#xA;library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this&#xA;case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free&#xA;software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free&#xA;programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of&#xA;free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in&#xA;non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU&#xA;operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating&#xA;system.&#xA;&#xA;  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the&#xA;users&apos; freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is&#xA;linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run&#xA;that program using a modified version of the Library.&#xA;&#xA;  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a&#xA;&quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;.  The&#xA;former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must&#xA;be combined with the library in order to run.&#xA;&#xA;    GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION&#xA;&#xA;  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other&#xA;program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or&#xA;other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of&#xA;this Lesser General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;).&#xA;Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data&#xA;prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs&#xA;(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work&#xA;which has been distributed under these terms.  A &quot;work based on the&#xA;Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under&#xA;copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a&#xA;portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated&#xA;straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is&#xA;included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for&#xA;making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means&#xA;all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated&#xA;interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation&#xA;and installation of the library.&#xA;&#xA;  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not&#xA;covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of&#xA;running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from&#xA;such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based&#xA;on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for&#xA;writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does&#xA;and what the program that uses the Library does.&#xA;  &#xA;  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library&apos;s&#xA;complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that&#xA;you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an&#xA;appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact&#xA;all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any&#xA;warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the&#xA;Library.&#xA;&#xA;  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,&#xA;and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a&#xA;fee.&#xA;&#xA;  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion&#xA;of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and&#xA;distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1&#xA;above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;&#xA;    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.&#xA;&#xA;    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices&#xA;    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.&#xA;&#xA;    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no&#xA;    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.&#xA;&#xA;    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a&#xA;    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses&#xA;    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility&#xA;    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,&#xA;    in the event an application does not supply such function or&#xA;    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of&#xA;    its purpose remains meaningful.&#xA;&#xA;    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has&#xA;    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the&#xA;    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any&#xA;    application-supplied function or table used by this function must&#xA;    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square&#xA;    root function must still compute square roots.)&#xA;&#xA;These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If&#xA;identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,&#xA;and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in&#xA;themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those&#xA;sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you&#xA;distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based&#xA;on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of&#xA;this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the&#xA;entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote&#xA;it.&#xA;&#xA;Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest&#xA;your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to&#xA;exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or&#xA;collective works based on the Library.&#xA;&#xA;In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library&#xA;with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of&#xA;a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under&#xA;the scope of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public&#xA;License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do&#xA;this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so&#xA;that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,&#xA;instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the&#xA;ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify&#xA;that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in&#xA;these notices.&#xA;&#xA;  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for&#xA;that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all&#xA;subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.&#xA;&#xA;  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of&#xA;the Library into a program that is not a library.&#xA;&#xA;  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or&#xA;derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form&#xA;under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany&#xA;it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which&#xA;must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a&#xA;medium customarily used for software interchange.&#xA;&#xA;  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy&#xA;from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the&#xA;source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to&#xA;distribute the source code, even though third parties are not&#xA;compelled to copy the source along with the object code.&#xA;&#xA;  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the&#xA;Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or&#xA;linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;.  Such a&#xA;work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and&#xA;therefore falls outside the scope of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library&#xA;creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it&#xA;contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses the&#xA;library&quot;.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.&#xA;Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.&#xA;&#xA;  When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header file&#xA;that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a&#xA;derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.&#xA;Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be&#xA;linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The&#xA;threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.&#xA;&#xA;  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data&#xA;structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline&#xA;functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object&#xA;file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative&#xA;work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the&#xA;Library will still fall under Section 6.)&#xA;&#xA;  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may&#xA;distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.&#xA;Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,&#xA;whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.&#xA;&#xA;  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or&#xA;link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce a&#xA;work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work&#xA;under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit&#xA;modification of the work for the customer&apos;s own use and reverse&#xA;engineering for debugging such modifications.&#xA;&#xA;  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the&#xA;Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by&#xA;this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work&#xA;during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the&#xA;copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference&#xA;directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one&#xA;of these things:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding&#xA;    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever&#xA;    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under&#xA;    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked&#xA;    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that&#xA;    uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that the&#xA;    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified&#xA;    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood&#xA;    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the&#xA;    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application&#xA;    to use the modified definitions.)&#xA;&#xA;    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the&#xA;    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a&#xA;    copy of the library already present on the user&apos;s computer system,&#xA;    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)&#xA;    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if&#xA;    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is&#xA;    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.&#xA;&#xA;    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at&#xA;    least three years, to give the same user the materials&#xA;    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more&#xA;    than the cost of performing this distribution.&#xA;&#xA;    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy&#xA;    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above&#xA;    specified materials from the same place.&#xA;&#xA;    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these&#xA;    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.&#xA;&#xA;  For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the&#xA;Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for&#xA;reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,&#xA;the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is&#xA;normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major&#xA;components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on&#xA;which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies&#xA;the executable.&#xA;&#xA;  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license&#xA;restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally&#xA;accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot&#xA;use both them and the Library together in an executable that you&#xA;distribute.&#xA;&#xA;  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the&#xA;Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library&#xA;facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined&#xA;library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on&#xA;the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise&#xA;permitted, and provided that you do these two things:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work&#xA;    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library&#xA;    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the&#xA;    Sections above.&#xA;&#xA;    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact&#xA;    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining&#xA;    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.&#xA;&#xA;  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute&#xA;the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any&#xA;attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or&#xA;distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your&#xA;rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,&#xA;or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses&#xA;terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.&#xA;&#xA;  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not&#xA;signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or&#xA;distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are&#xA;prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by&#xA;modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the&#xA;Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and&#xA;all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying&#xA;the Library or works based on it.&#xA;&#xA;  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the&#xA;Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the&#xA;original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library&#xA;subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further&#xA;restrictions on the recipients&apos; exercise of the rights granted herein.&#xA;You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with&#xA;this License.&#xA;&#xA;  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent&#xA;infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),&#xA;conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot&#xA;distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you&#xA;may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent&#xA;license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by&#xA;all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then&#xA;the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to&#xA;refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.&#xA;&#xA;If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any&#xA;particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,&#xA;and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.&#xA;&#xA;It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any&#xA;patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any&#xA;such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the&#xA;integrity of the free software distribution system which is&#xA;implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made&#xA;generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed&#xA;through that system in reliance on consistent application of that&#xA;system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing&#xA;to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot&#xA;impose that choice.&#xA;&#xA;This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to&#xA;be a consequence of the rest of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in&#xA;certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the&#xA;original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add&#xA;an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,&#xA;so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus&#xA;excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if&#xA;written in the body of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new&#xA;versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.&#xA;Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,&#xA;but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.&#xA;&#xA;Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library&#xA;specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and&#xA;&quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and&#xA;conditions either of that version or of any later version published by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a&#xA;license version number, you may choose any version ever published by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation.&#xA;&#xA;  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free&#xA;programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,&#xA;write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is&#xA;copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free&#xA;Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our&#xA;decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status&#xA;of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing&#xA;and reuse of software generally.&#xA;&#xA;       NO WARRANTY&#xA;&#xA;  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO&#xA;WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.&#xA;EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR&#xA;OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY&#xA;KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE&#xA;IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#xA;PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE&#xA;LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME&#xA;THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;&#xA;  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN&#xA;WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY&#xA;AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU&#xA;FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR&#xA;CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE&#xA;LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING&#xA;RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A&#xA;FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF&#xA;SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH&#xA;DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;       END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;&#xA;           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries&#xA;&#xA;  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest&#xA;possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that&#xA;everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting&#xA;redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the&#xA;ordinary General Public License).&#xA;&#xA;  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is&#xA;safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively&#xA;convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the&#xA;&quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.&#xA;&#xA;    &lt;one line to give the library&apos;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;&#xA;    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;&#xA;&#xA;    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or&#xA;    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either&#xA;    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.&#xA;&#xA;    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,&#xA;    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of&#xA;    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU&#xA;    Lesser General Public License for more details.&#xA;&#xA;    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software&#xA;    Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA&#xA;&#xA;Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.&#xA;&#xA;You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your&#xA;school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the library, if&#xA;necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:&#xA;&#xA;  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the&#xA;  library `Frob&apos; (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.&#xA;&#xA;  &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1990&#xA;  Ty Coon, President of Vice&#xA;&#xA;That&apos;s all there is to it!

          GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;Version 2.1, February 1999&#xA;Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.&#xA;59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA&#xA;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies&#xA;of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.&#xA;[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also&#xA;counts&#xA;as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2,&#xA;hence&#xA;the version number 2.1.]&#xA;Preamble&#xA;The licenses for most software are designed to take away your&#xA;freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General&#xA;Public&#xA;Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and&#xA;change&#xA;free software--to make sure the software is free for all its&#xA;users.&#xA;This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some&#xA;specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of&#xA;the&#xA;Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use&#xA;it.  You&#xA;can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about&#xA;whether&#xA;this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better&#xA;strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations&#xA;below.&#xA;When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of&#xA;use,&#xA;not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make&#xA;sure that&#xA;you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and&#xA;charge&#xA;for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or&#xA;can get&#xA;it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces&#xA;of&#xA;it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can&#xA;do&#xA;these things.&#xA;To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid&#xA;distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender&#xA;these&#xA;rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities&#xA;for&#xA;you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify&#xA;it.&#xA;For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether&#xA;gratis&#xA;or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that&#xA;we gave&#xA;you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the&#xA;source&#xA;code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide&#xA;complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink&#xA;them&#xA;with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling&#xA;it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.&#xA;We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright&#xA;the&#xA;library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal&#xA;permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.&#xA;To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that&#xA;there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library&#xA;is&#xA;modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should&#xA;know&#xA;that what they have is not the original version, so that the&#xA;original&#xA;author&apos;s reputation will not be affected by problems that might&#xA;be&#xA;introduced by others.&#xA;Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence&#xA;of&#xA;any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot&#xA;effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining&#xA;a&#xA;restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist&#xA;that&#xA;any patent license obtained for a version of the library must&#xA;be&#xA;consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.&#xA;Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the&#xA;ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser&#xA;General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries,&#xA;and&#xA;is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.&#xA;We use&#xA;this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking&#xA;those&#xA;libraries into non-free programs.&#xA;When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or&#xA;using&#xA;a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking&#xA;a&#xA;combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary&#xA;General Public License therefore permits such linking only if&#xA;the&#xA;entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser&#xA;General&#xA;Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code&#xA;with&#xA;the library.&#xA;We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because&#xA;it&#xA;does Less to protect the user&apos;s freedom than the ordinary General&#xA;Public License.  It also provides other free software developers&#xA;Less&#xA;of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages&#xA;are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for&#xA;many&#xA;libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in&#xA;certain&#xA;special circumstances.&#xA;For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to&#xA;encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that&#xA;it becomes&#xA;a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must&#xA;be&#xA;allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free&#xA;library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.&#xA;In this&#xA;case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to&#xA;free&#xA;software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.&#xA;In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free&#xA;programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body&#xA;of&#xA;free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library&#xA;in&#xA;non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU&#xA;operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating&#xA;system.&#xA;Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective&#xA;of the&#xA;users&apos; freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that&#xA;is&#xA;linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to&#xA;run&#xA;that program using a modified version of the Library.&#xA;The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between&#xA;a&#xA;&quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;.&#xA;The&#xA;former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter&#xA;must&#xA;be combined with the library in order to run.&#xA;GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION&#xA;0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or&#xA;other&#xA;program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder&#xA;or&#xA;other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the&#xA;terms of&#xA;this Lesser General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;).&#xA;Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.&#xA;A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data&#xA;prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs&#xA;(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.&#xA;The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or&#xA;work&#xA;which has been distributed under these terms.  A &quot;work based&#xA;on the&#xA;Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under&#xA;copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library&#xA;or a&#xA;portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated&#xA;straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation&#xA;is&#xA;included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)&#xA;&quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work&#xA;for&#xA;making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code&#xA;means&#xA;all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated&#xA;interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control&#xA;compilation&#xA;and installation of the library.&#xA;Activities other than copying, distribution and modification&#xA;are not&#xA;covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act&#xA;of&#xA;running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output&#xA;from&#xA;such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work&#xA;based&#xA;on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool&#xA;for&#xA;writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library&#xA;does&#xA;and what the program that uses the Library does.&#xA;1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library&apos;s&#xA;complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided&#xA;that&#xA;you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an&#xA;appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep&#xA;intact&#xA;all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence&#xA;of any&#xA;warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the&#xA;Library.&#xA;You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,&#xA;and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange&#xA;for a&#xA;fee.&#xA;2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion&#xA;of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and&#xA;distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section&#xA;1&#xA;above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;a) The modified work must itself be a software library.&#xA;b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices&#xA;stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.&#xA;c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no&#xA;charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.&#xA;d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function&#xA;or a&#xA;table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses&#xA;the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility&#xA;is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure&#xA;that,&#xA;in the event an application does not supply such function or&#xA;table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part&#xA;of&#xA;its purpose remains meaningful.&#xA;(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots&#xA;has&#xA;a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the&#xA;application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any&#xA;application-supplied function or table used by this function&#xA;must&#xA;be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square&#xA;root function must still compute square roots.)&#xA;These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If&#xA;identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,&#xA;and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works&#xA;in&#xA;themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to&#xA;those&#xA;sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when&#xA;you&#xA;distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work&#xA;based&#xA;on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the&#xA;terms of&#xA;this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to&#xA;the&#xA;entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who&#xA;wrote&#xA;it.&#xA;Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or&#xA;contest&#xA;your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent&#xA;is to&#xA;exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative&#xA;or&#xA;collective works based on the Library.&#xA;In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the&#xA;Library&#xA;with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume&#xA;of&#xA;a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work&#xA;under&#xA;the scope of this License.&#xA;3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General&#xA;Public&#xA;License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.&#xA;To do&#xA;this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License,&#xA;so&#xA;that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version&#xA;2,&#xA;instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version&#xA;2 of the&#xA;ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can&#xA;specify&#xA;that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change&#xA;in&#xA;these notices.&#xA;Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible&#xA;for&#xA;that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies&#xA;to all&#xA;subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.&#xA;This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code&#xA;of&#xA;the Library into a program that is not a library.&#xA;4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or&#xA;derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable&#xA;form&#xA;under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany&#xA;it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code,&#xA;which&#xA;must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above&#xA;on a&#xA;medium customarily used for software interchange.&#xA;If distribution of object code is made by offering access to&#xA;copy&#xA;from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy&#xA;the&#xA;source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to&#xA;distribute the source code, even though third parties are not&#xA;compelled to copy the source along with the object code.&#xA;5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the&#xA;Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled&#xA;or&#xA;linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;.  Such&#xA;a&#xA;work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library,&#xA;and&#xA;therefore falls outside the scope of this License.&#xA;However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library&#xA;creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because&#xA;it&#xA;contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses&#xA;the&#xA;library&quot;.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.&#xA;Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.&#xA;When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header&#xA;file&#xA;that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may&#xA;be a&#xA;derivative work of the Library even though the source code is&#xA;not.&#xA;Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can&#xA;be&#xA;linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.&#xA;The&#xA;threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.&#xA;If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data&#xA;structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline&#xA;functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the&#xA;object&#xA;file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative&#xA;work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions&#xA;of the&#xA;Library will still fall under Section 6.)&#xA;Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may&#xA;distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section&#xA;6.&#xA;Any executables containing that work also fall under Section&#xA;6,&#xA;whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.&#xA;6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine&#xA;or&#xA;link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce&#xA;a&#xA;work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that&#xA;work&#xA;under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit&#xA;modification of the work for the customer&apos;s own use and reverse&#xA;engineering for debugging such modifications.&#xA;You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that&#xA;the&#xA;Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered&#xA;by&#xA;this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the&#xA;work&#xA;during execution displays copyright notices, you must include&#xA;the&#xA;copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference&#xA;directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must&#xA;do one&#xA;of these things:&#xA;a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding&#xA;machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever&#xA;changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under&#xA;Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked&#xA;with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that&#xA;uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that&#xA;the&#xA;user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified&#xA;executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood&#xA;that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in&#xA;the&#xA;Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application&#xA;to use the modified definitions.)&#xA;b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the&#xA;Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time&#xA;a&#xA;copy of the library already present on the user&apos;s computer system,&#xA;rather than copying library functions into the executable, and&#xA;(2)&#xA;will operate properly with a modified version of the library,&#xA;if&#xA;the user installs one, as long as the modified version is&#xA;interface-compatible with the version that the work was made&#xA;with.&#xA;c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at&#xA;least three years, to give the same user the materials&#xA;specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more&#xA;than the cost of performing this distribution.&#xA;d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to&#xA;copy&#xA;from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the&#xA;above&#xA;specified materials from the same place.&#xA;e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these&#xA;materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.&#xA;For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the&#xA;Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for&#xA;reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,&#xA;the materials to be distributed need not include anything that&#xA;is&#xA;normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the&#xA;major&#xA;components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system&#xA;on&#xA;which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies&#xA;the executable.&#xA;It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license&#xA;restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally&#xA;accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you&#xA;cannot&#xA;use both them and the Library together in an executable that&#xA;you&#xA;distribute.&#xA;7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on&#xA;the&#xA;Library side-by-side in a single library together with other&#xA;library&#xA;facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a&#xA;combined&#xA;library, provided that the separate distribution of the work&#xA;based on&#xA;the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise&#xA;permitted, and provided that you do these two things:&#xA;a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work&#xA;based on the Library, uncombined with any other library&#xA;facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the&#xA;Sections above.&#xA;b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact&#xA;that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining&#xA;where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.&#xA;8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute&#xA;the Library except as expressly provided under this License.&#xA;Any&#xA;attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or&#xA;distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate&#xA;your&#xA;rights under this License.  However, parties who have received&#xA;copies,&#xA;or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses&#xA;terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.&#xA;9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have&#xA;not&#xA;signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify&#xA;or&#xA;distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions&#xA;are&#xA;prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore,&#xA;by&#xA;modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the&#xA;Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do&#xA;so, and&#xA;all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying&#xA;the Library or works based on it.&#xA;10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based&#xA;on the&#xA;Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from&#xA;the&#xA;original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the&#xA;Library&#xA;subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any&#xA;further&#xA;restrictions on the recipients&apos; exercise of the rights granted&#xA;herein.&#xA;You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties&#xA;with&#xA;this License.&#xA;11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of&#xA;patent&#xA;infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),&#xA;conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement&#xA;or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they&#xA;do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot&#xA;distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under&#xA;this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence&#xA;you&#xA;may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent&#xA;license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library&#xA;by&#xA;all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you,&#xA;then&#xA;the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would&#xA;be to&#xA;refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.&#xA;If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable&#xA;under any&#xA;particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended&#xA;to apply,&#xA;and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.&#xA;It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe&#xA;any&#xA;patents or other property right claims or to contest validity&#xA;of any&#xA;such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting&#xA;the&#xA;integrity of the free software distribution system which is&#xA;implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made&#xA;generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed&#xA;through that system in reliance on consistent application of&#xA;that&#xA;system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is&#xA;willing&#xA;to distribute software through any other system and a licensee&#xA;cannot&#xA;impose that choice.&#xA;This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed&#xA;to&#xA;be a consequence of the rest of this License.&#xA;12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted&#xA;in&#xA;certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,&#xA;the&#xA;original copyright holder who places the Library under this License&#xA;may add&#xA;an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those&#xA;countries,&#xA;so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries&#xA;not thus&#xA;excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation&#xA;as if&#xA;written in the body of this License.&#xA;13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new&#xA;versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.&#xA;Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,&#xA;but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.&#xA;Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&#xA;Library&#xA;specifies a version number of this License which applies to it&#xA;and&#xA;&quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms&#xA;and&#xA;conditions either of that version or of any later version published&#xA;by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify&#xA;a&#xA;license version number, you may choose any version ever published&#xA;by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation.&#xA;14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other&#xA;free&#xA;programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with&#xA;these,&#xA;write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which&#xA;is&#xA;copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free&#xA;Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. &#xA;Our&#xA;decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free&#xA;status&#xA;of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the&#xA;sharing&#xA;and reuse of software generally.&#xA;NO WARRANTY&#xA;15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS&#xA;NO&#xA;WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE&#xA;LAW.&#xA;EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS&#xA;AND/OR&#xA;OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF&#xA;ANY&#xA;KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED&#xA;TO, THE&#xA;IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#xA;PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF&#xA;THE&#xA;LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU&#xA;ASSUME&#xA;THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO&#xA;IN&#xA;WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY&#xA;MODIFY&#xA;AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE&#xA;TO YOU&#xA;FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR&#xA;CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO&#xA;USE THE&#xA;LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING&#xA;RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES&#xA;OR A&#xA;FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN&#xA;IF&#xA;SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY&#xA;OF SUCH&#xA;DAMAGES.&#xA;END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries&#xA;If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest&#xA;possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software&#xA;that&#xA;everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting&#xA;redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the&#xA;terms of the&#xA;ordinary General Public License).&#xA;To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.&#xA;It is&#xA;safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most&#xA;effectively&#xA;convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at&#xA;least the&#xA;&quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.&#xA;&lt;one line to give the library&apos;s name and a brief idea of what&#xA;it does.&gt;&#xA;Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;&#xA;This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or&#xA;modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either&#xA;version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.&#xA;This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,&#xA;but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of&#xA;MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the&#xA;GNU&#xA;Lesser General Public License for more details.&#xA;You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software&#xA;Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307&#xA;USA&#xA;Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and&#xA;paper mail.&#xA;You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer)&#xA;or your&#xA;school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the library,&#xA;if&#xA;necessary.

It also counts&#xA; as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence&#xA; the version number 2.1.]&#xA;&#xA;       Preamble&#xA;&#xA;  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your&#xA;freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public&#xA;Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change&#xA;free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.&#xA;&#xA;  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some&#xA;specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the&#xA;Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You&#xA;can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether&#xA;this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better&#xA;strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.&#xA;&#xA;  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,&#xA;not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that&#xA;you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge&#xA;for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get&#xA;it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of&#xA;it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do&#xA;these things.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid&#xA;distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these&#xA;rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for&#xA;you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis&#xA;or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave&#xA;you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source&#xA;code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide&#xA;complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them&#xA;with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling&#xA;it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.&#xA;&#xA;  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the&#xA;library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal&#xA;permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that&#xA;there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is&#xA;modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know&#xA;that what they have is not the original version, so that the original&#xA;author&apos;s reputation will not be affected by problems that might be&#xA;introduced by others.&#xA;&#xA;  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of&#xA;any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot&#xA;effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a&#xA;restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that&#xA;any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be&#xA;consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.&#xA;&#xA;  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the&#xA;ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser&#xA;General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and&#xA;is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use&#xA;this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those&#xA;libraries into non-free programs.&#xA;&#xA;  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using&#xA;a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a&#xA;combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary&#xA;General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the&#xA;entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General&#xA;Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with&#xA;the library.&#xA;&#xA;  We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because it&#xA;does Less to protect the user&apos;s freedom than the ordinary General&#xA;Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less&#xA;of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages&#xA;are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many&#xA;libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain&#xA;special circumstances.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to&#xA;encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes&#xA;a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be&#xA;allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free&#xA;library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this&#xA;case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free&#xA;software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free&#xA;programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of&#xA;free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in&#xA;non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU&#xA;operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating&#xA;system.&#xA;&#xA;  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the&#xA;users&apos; freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is&#xA;linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run&#xA;that program using a modified version of the Library.&#xA;&#xA;  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a&#xA;&quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;.  The&#xA;former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must&#xA;be combined with the library in order to run.&#xA;&#xA;    GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION&#xA;&#xA;  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other&#xA;program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or&#xA;other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of&#xA;this Lesser General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;).&#xA;Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data&#xA;prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs&#xA;(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work&#xA;which has been distributed under these terms.  A &quot;work based on the&#xA;Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under&#xA;copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a&#xA;portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated&#xA;straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is&#xA;included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for&#xA;making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means&#xA;all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated&#xA;interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation&#xA;and installation of the library.&#xA;&#xA;  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not&#xA;covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of&#xA;running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from&#xA;such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based&#xA;on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for&#xA;writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does&#xA;and what the program that uses the Library does.&#xA;  &#xA;  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library&apos;s&#xA;complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that&#xA;you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an&#xA;appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact&#xA;all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any&#xA;warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the&#xA;Library.&#xA;&#xA;  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,&#xA;and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a&#xA;fee.&#xA;&#xA;  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion&#xA;of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and&#xA;distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1&#xA;above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;&#xA;    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.&#xA;&#xA;    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices&#xA;    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.&#xA;&#xA;    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no&#xA;    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.&#xA;&#xA;    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a&#xA;    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses&#xA;    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility&#xA;    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,&#xA;    in the event an application does not supply such function or&#xA;    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of&#xA;    its purpose remains meaningful.&#xA;&#xA;    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has&#xA;    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the&#xA;    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any&#xA;    application-supplied function or table used by this function must&#xA;    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square&#xA;    root function must still compute square roots.)&#xA;&#xA;These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If&#xA;identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,&#xA;and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in&#xA;themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those&#xA;sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you&#xA;distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based&#xA;on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of&#xA;this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the&#xA;entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote&#xA;it.&#xA;&#xA;Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest&#xA;your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to&#xA;exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or&#xA;collective works based on the Library.&#xA;&#xA;In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library&#xA;with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of&#xA;a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under&#xA;the scope of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public&#xA;License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do&#xA;this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so&#xA;that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,&#xA;instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the&#xA;ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify&#xA;that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in&#xA;these notices.&#xA;&#xA;  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for&#xA;that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all&#xA;subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.&#xA;&#xA;  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of&#xA;the Library into a program that is not a library.&#xA;&#xA;  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or&#xA;derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form&#xA;under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany&#xA;it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which&#xA;must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a&#xA;medium customarily used for software interchange.&#xA;&#xA;  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy&#xA;from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the&#xA;source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to&#xA;distribute the source code, even though third parties are not&#xA;compelled to copy the source along with the object code.&#xA;&#xA;  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the&#xA;Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or&#xA;linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;.  Such a&#xA;work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and&#xA;therefore falls outside the scope of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library&#xA;creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it&#xA;contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses the&#xA;library&quot;.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.&#xA;Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.&#xA;&#xA;  When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header file&#xA;that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a&#xA;derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.&#xA;Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be&#xA;linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The&#xA;threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.&#xA;&#xA;  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data&#xA;structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline&#xA;functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object&#xA;file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative&#xA;work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the&#xA;Library will still fall under Section 6.)&#xA;&#xA;  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may&#xA;distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.&#xA;Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,&#xA;whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.&#xA;&#xA;  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or&#xA;link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce a&#xA;work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work&#xA;under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit&#xA;modification of the work for the customer&apos;s own use and reverse&#xA;engineering for debugging such modifications.&#xA;&#xA;  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the&#xA;Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by&#xA;this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work&#xA;during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the&#xA;copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference&#xA;directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one&#xA;of these things:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding&#xA;    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever&#xA;    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under&#xA;    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked&#xA;    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that&#xA;    uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that the&#xA;    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified&#xA;    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood&#xA;    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the&#xA;    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application&#xA;    to use the modified definitions.)&#xA;&#xA;    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the&#xA;    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a&#xA;    copy of the library already present on the user&apos;s computer system,&#xA;    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)&#xA;    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if&#xA;    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is&#xA;    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.&#xA;&#xA;    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at&#xA;    least three years, to give the same user the materials&#xA;    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more&#xA;    than the cost of performing this distribution.&#xA;&#xA;    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy&#xA;    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above&#xA;    specified materials from the same place.&#xA;&#xA;    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these&#xA;    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.&#xA;&#xA;  For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the&#xA;Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for&#xA;reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,&#xA;the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is&#xA;normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major&#xA;components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on&#xA;which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies&#xA;the executable.&#xA;&#xA;  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license&#xA;restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally&#xA;accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot&#xA;use both them and the Library together in an executable that you&#xA;distribute.&#xA;&#xA;  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the&#xA;Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library&#xA;facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined&#xA;library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on&#xA;the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise&#xA;permitted, and provided that you do these two things:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work&#xA;    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library&#xA;    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the&#xA;    Sections above.&#xA;&#xA;    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact&#xA;    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining&#xA;    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.&#xA;&#xA;  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute&#xA;the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any&#xA;attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or&#xA;distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your&#xA;rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,&#xA;or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses&#xA;terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.&#xA;&#xA;  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not&#xA;signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or&#xA;distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are&#xA;prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by&#xA;modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the&#xA;Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and&#xA;all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying&#xA;the Library or works based on it.&#xA;&#xA;  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the&#xA;Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the&#xA;original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library&#xA;subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further&#xA;restrictions on the recipients&apos; exercise of the rights granted herein.&#xA;You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with&#xA;this License.&#xA;&#xA;  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent&#xA;infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),&#xA;conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot&#xA;distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you&#xA;may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent&#xA;license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by&#xA;all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then&#xA;the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to&#xA;refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.&#xA;&#xA;If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any&#xA;particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,&#xA;and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.&#xA;&#xA;It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any&#xA;patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any&#xA;such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the&#xA;integrity of the free software distribution system which is&#xA;implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made&#xA;generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed&#xA;through that system in reliance on consistent application of that&#xA;system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing&#xA;to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot&#xA;impose that choice.&#xA;&#xA;This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to&#xA;be a consequence of the rest of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in&#xA;certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the&#xA;original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add&#xA;an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,&#xA;so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus&#xA;excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if&#xA;written in the body of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new&#xA;versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.&#xA;Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,&#xA;but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.&#xA;&#xA;Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library&#xA;specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and&#xA;&quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and&#xA;conditions either of that version or of any later version published by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a&#xA;license version number, you may choose any version ever published by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation.&#xA;&#xA;  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free&#xA;programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,&#xA;write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is&#xA;copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free&#xA;Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our&#xA;decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status&#xA;of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing&#xA;and reuse of software generally.&#xA;&#xA;       NO WARRANTY&#xA;&#xA;  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO&#xA;WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.&#xA;EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR&#xA;OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY&#xA;KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE&#xA;IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#xA;PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE&#xA;LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME&#xA;THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;&#xA;  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN&#xA;WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY&#xA;AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU&#xA;FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR&#xA;CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE&#xA;LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING&#xA;RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A&#xA;FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF&#xA;SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH&#xA;DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;       END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;&#xA;           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries&#xA;&#xA;  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest&#xA;possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that&#xA;everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting&#xA;redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the&#xA;ordinary General Public License).&#xA;&#xA;  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is&#xA;safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively&#xA;convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the&#xA;&quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.&#xA;&#xA;    &lt;one line to give the library&apos;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;&#xA;    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;&#xA;&#xA;    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or&#xA;    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either&#xA;    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.&#xA;&#xA;    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,&#xA;    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of&#xA;    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU&#xA;    Lesser General Public License for more details.&#xA;&#xA;    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software&#xA;    Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA&#xA;&#xA;Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.&#xA;&#xA;You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your&#xA;school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the library, if&#xA;necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:&#xA;&#xA;  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the&#xA;  library `Frob&apos; (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.&#xA;&#xA;  &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1990&#xA;  Ty Coon, President of Vice&#xA;&#xA;That&apos;s all there is to it!

          GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;Version 2.1, February 1999&#xA;Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.&#xA;59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA&#xA;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies&#xA;of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.&#xA;[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also&#xA;counts&#xA;as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2,&#xA;hence&#xA;the version number 2.1.]&#xA;Preamble&#xA;The licenses for most software are designed to take away your&#xA;freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General&#xA;Public&#xA;Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and&#xA;change&#xA;free software--to make sure the software is free for all its&#xA;users.&#xA;This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some&#xA;specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of&#xA;the&#xA;Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use&#xA;it.  You&#xA;can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about&#xA;whether&#xA;this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better&#xA;strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations&#xA;below.&#xA;When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of&#xA;use,&#xA;not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make&#xA;sure that&#xA;you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and&#xA;charge&#xA;for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or&#xA;can get&#xA;it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces&#xA;of&#xA;it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can&#xA;do&#xA;these things.&#xA;To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid&#xA;distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender&#xA;these&#xA;rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities&#xA;for&#xA;you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify&#xA;it.&#xA;For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether&#xA;gratis&#xA;or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that&#xA;we gave&#xA;you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the&#xA;source&#xA;code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide&#xA;complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink&#xA;them&#xA;with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling&#xA;it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.&#xA;We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright&#xA;the&#xA;library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal&#xA;permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.&#xA;To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that&#xA;there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library&#xA;is&#xA;modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should&#xA;know&#xA;that what they have is not the original version, so that the&#xA;original&#xA;author&apos;s reputation will not be affected by problems that might&#xA;be&#xA;introduced by others.&#xA;Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence&#xA;of&#xA;any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot&#xA;effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining&#xA;a&#xA;restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist&#xA;that&#xA;any patent license obtained for a version of the library must&#xA;be&#xA;consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.&#xA;Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the&#xA;ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser&#xA;General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries,&#xA;and&#xA;is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.&#xA;We use&#xA;this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking&#xA;those&#xA;libraries into non-free programs.&#xA;When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or&#xA;using&#xA;a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking&#xA;a&#xA;combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary&#xA;General Public License therefore permits such linking only if&#xA;the&#xA;entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser&#xA;General&#xA;Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code&#xA;with&#xA;the library.&#xA;We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because&#xA;it&#xA;does Less to protect the user&apos;s freedom than the ordinary General&#xA;Public License.  It also provides other free software developers&#xA;Less&#xA;of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages&#xA;are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for&#xA;many&#xA;libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in&#xA;certain&#xA;special circumstances.&#xA;For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to&#xA;encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that&#xA;it becomes&#xA;a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must&#xA;be&#xA;allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free&#xA;library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.&#xA;In this&#xA;case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to&#xA;free&#xA;software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.&#xA;In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free&#xA;programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body&#xA;of&#xA;free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library&#xA;in&#xA;non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU&#xA;operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating&#xA;system.&#xA;Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective&#xA;of the&#xA;users&apos; freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that&#xA;is&#xA;linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to&#xA;run&#xA;that program using a modified version of the Library.&#xA;The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between&#xA;a&#xA;&quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;.&#xA;The&#xA;former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter&#xA;must&#xA;be combined with the library in order to run.&#xA;GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION&#xA;0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or&#xA;other&#xA;program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder&#xA;or&#xA;other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the&#xA;terms of&#xA;this Lesser General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;).&#xA;Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.&#xA;A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data&#xA;prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs&#xA;(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.&#xA;The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or&#xA;work&#xA;which has been distributed under these terms.  A &quot;work based&#xA;on the&#xA;Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under&#xA;copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library&#xA;or a&#xA;portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated&#xA;straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation&#xA;is&#xA;included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)&#xA;&quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work&#xA;for&#xA;making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code&#xA;means&#xA;all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated&#xA;interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control&#xA;compilation&#xA;and installation of the library.&#xA;Activities other than copying, distribution and modification&#xA;are not&#xA;covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act&#xA;of&#xA;running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output&#xA;from&#xA;such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work&#xA;based&#xA;on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool&#xA;for&#xA;writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library&#xA;does&#xA;and what the program that uses the Library does.&#xA;1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library&apos;s&#xA;complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided&#xA;that&#xA;you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an&#xA;appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep&#xA;intact&#xA;all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence&#xA;of any&#xA;warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the&#xA;Library.&#xA;You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,&#xA;and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange&#xA;for a&#xA;fee.&#xA;2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion&#xA;of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and&#xA;distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section&#xA;1&#xA;above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;a) The modified work must itself be a software library.&#xA;b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices&#xA;stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.&#xA;c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no&#xA;charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.&#xA;d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function&#xA;or a&#xA;table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses&#xA;the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility&#xA;is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure&#xA;that,&#xA;in the event an application does not supply such function or&#xA;table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part&#xA;of&#xA;its purpose remains meaningful.&#xA;(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots&#xA;has&#xA;a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the&#xA;application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any&#xA;application-supplied function or table used by this function&#xA;must&#xA;be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square&#xA;root function must still compute square roots.)&#xA;These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If&#xA;identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,&#xA;and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works&#xA;in&#xA;themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to&#xA;those&#xA;sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when&#xA;you&#xA;distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work&#xA;based&#xA;on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the&#xA;terms of&#xA;this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to&#xA;the&#xA;entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who&#xA;wrote&#xA;it.&#xA;Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or&#xA;contest&#xA;your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent&#xA;is to&#xA;exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative&#xA;or&#xA;collective works based on the Library.&#xA;In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the&#xA;Library&#xA;with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume&#xA;of&#xA;a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work&#xA;under&#xA;the scope of this License.&#xA;3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General&#xA;Public&#xA;License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.&#xA;To do&#xA;this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License,&#xA;so&#xA;that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version&#xA;2,&#xA;instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version&#xA;2 of the&#xA;ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can&#xA;specify&#xA;that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change&#xA;in&#xA;these notices.&#xA;Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible&#xA;for&#xA;that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies&#xA;to all&#xA;subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.&#xA;This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code&#xA;of&#xA;the Library into a program that is not a library.&#xA;4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or&#xA;derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable&#xA;form&#xA;under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany&#xA;it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code,&#xA;which&#xA;must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above&#xA;on a&#xA;medium customarily used for software interchange.&#xA;If distribution of object code is made by offering access to&#xA;copy&#xA;from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy&#xA;the&#xA;source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to&#xA;distribute the source code, even though third parties are not&#xA;compelled to copy the source along with the object code.&#xA;5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the&#xA;Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled&#xA;or&#xA;linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;.  Such&#xA;a&#xA;work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library,&#xA;and&#xA;therefore falls outside the scope of this License.&#xA;However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library&#xA;creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because&#xA;it&#xA;contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses&#xA;the&#xA;library&quot;.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.&#xA;Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.&#xA;When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header&#xA;file&#xA;that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may&#xA;be a&#xA;derivative work of the Library even though the source code is&#xA;not.&#xA;Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can&#xA;be&#xA;linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.&#xA;The&#xA;threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.&#xA;If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data&#xA;structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline&#xA;functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the&#xA;object&#xA;file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative&#xA;work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions&#xA;of the&#xA;Library will still fall under Section 6.)&#xA;Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may&#xA;distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section&#xA;6.&#xA;Any executables containing that work also fall under Section&#xA;6,&#xA;whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.&#xA;6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine&#xA;or&#xA;link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce&#xA;a&#xA;work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that&#xA;work&#xA;under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit&#xA;modification of the work for the customer&apos;s own use and reverse&#xA;engineering for debugging such modifications.&#xA;You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that&#xA;the&#xA;Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered&#xA;by&#xA;this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the&#xA;work&#xA;during execution displays copyright notices, you must include&#xA;the&#xA;copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference&#xA;directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must&#xA;do one&#xA;of these things:&#xA;a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding&#xA;machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever&#xA;changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under&#xA;Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked&#xA;with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that&#xA;uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that&#xA;the&#xA;user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified&#xA;executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood&#xA;that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in&#xA;the&#xA;Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application&#xA;to use the modified definitions.)&#xA;b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the&#xA;Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time&#xA;a&#xA;copy of the library already present on the user&apos;s computer system,&#xA;rather than copying library functions into the executable, and&#xA;(2)&#xA;will operate properly with a modified version of the library,&#xA;if&#xA;the user installs one, as long as the modified version is&#xA;interface-compatible with the version that the work was made&#xA;with.&#xA;c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at&#xA;least three years, to give the same user the materials&#xA;specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more&#xA;than the cost of performing this distribution.&#xA;d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to&#xA;copy&#xA;from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the&#xA;above&#xA;specified materials from the same place.&#xA;e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these&#xA;materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.&#xA;For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the&#xA;Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for&#xA;reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,&#xA;the materials to be distributed need not include anything that&#xA;is&#xA;normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the&#xA;major&#xA;components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system&#xA;on&#xA;which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies&#xA;the executable.&#xA;It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license&#xA;restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally&#xA;accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you&#xA;cannot&#xA;use both them and the Library together in an executable that&#xA;you&#xA;distribute.&#xA;7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on&#xA;the&#xA;Library side-by-side in a single library together with other&#xA;library&#xA;facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a&#xA;combined&#xA;library, provided that the separate distribution of the work&#xA;based on&#xA;the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise&#xA;permitted, and provided that you do these two things:&#xA;a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work&#xA;based on the Library, uncombined with any other library&#xA;facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the&#xA;Sections above.&#xA;b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact&#xA;that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining&#xA;where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.&#xA;8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute&#xA;the Library except as expressly provided under this License.&#xA;Any&#xA;attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or&#xA;distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate&#xA;your&#xA;rights under this License.  However, parties who have received&#xA;copies,&#xA;or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses&#xA;terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.&#xA;9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have&#xA;not&#xA;signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify&#xA;or&#xA;distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions&#xA;are&#xA;prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore,&#xA;by&#xA;modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the&#xA;Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do&#xA;so, and&#xA;all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying&#xA;the Library or works based on it.&#xA;10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based&#xA;on the&#xA;Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from&#xA;the&#xA;original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the&#xA;Library&#xA;subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any&#xA;further&#xA;restrictions on the recipients&apos; exercise of the rights granted&#xA;herein.&#xA;You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties&#xA;with&#xA;this License.&#xA;11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of&#xA;patent&#xA;infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),&#xA;conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement&#xA;or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they&#xA;do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot&#xA;distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under&#xA;this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence&#xA;you&#xA;may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent&#xA;license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library&#xA;by&#xA;all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you,&#xA;then&#xA;the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would&#xA;be to&#xA;refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.&#xA;If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable&#xA;under any&#xA;particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended&#xA;to apply,&#xA;and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.&#xA;It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe&#xA;any&#xA;patents or other property right claims or to contest validity&#xA;of any&#xA;such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting&#xA;the&#xA;integrity of the free software distribution system which is&#xA;implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made&#xA;generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed&#xA;through that system in reliance on consistent application of&#xA;that&#xA;system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is&#xA;willing&#xA;to distribute software through any other system and a licensee&#xA;cannot&#xA;impose that choice.&#xA;This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed&#xA;to&#xA;be a consequence of the rest of this License.&#xA;12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted&#xA;in&#xA;certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,&#xA;the&#xA;original copyright holder who places the Library under this License&#xA;may add&#xA;an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those&#xA;countries,&#xA;so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries&#xA;not thus&#xA;excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation&#xA;as if&#xA;written in the body of this License.&#xA;13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new&#xA;versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.&#xA;Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,&#xA;but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.&#xA;Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&#xA;Library&#xA;specifies a version number of this License which applies to it&#xA;and&#xA;&quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms&#xA;and&#xA;conditions either of that version or of any later version published&#xA;by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify&#xA;a&#xA;license version number, you may choose any version ever published&#xA;by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation.&#xA;14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other&#xA;free&#xA;programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with&#xA;these,&#xA;write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which&#xA;is&#xA;copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free&#xA;Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. &#xA;Our&#xA;decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free&#xA;status&#xA;of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the&#xA;sharing&#xA;and reuse of software generally.&#xA;NO WARRANTY&#xA;15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS&#xA;NO&#xA;WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE&#xA;LAW.&#xA;EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS&#xA;AND/OR&#xA;OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF&#xA;ANY&#xA;KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED&#xA;TO, THE&#xA;IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#xA;PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF&#xA;THE&#xA;LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU&#xA;ASSUME&#xA;THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO&#xA;IN&#xA;WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY&#xA;MODIFY&#xA;AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE&#xA;TO YOU&#xA;FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR&#xA;CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO&#xA;USE THE&#xA;LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING&#xA;RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES&#xA;OR A&#xA;FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN&#xA;IF&#xA;SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY&#xA;OF SUCH&#xA;DAMAGES.&#xA;END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries&#xA;If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest&#xA;possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software&#xA;that&#xA;everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting&#xA;redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the&#xA;terms of the&#xA;ordinary General Public License).&#xA;To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.&#xA;It is&#xA;safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most&#xA;effectively&#xA;convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at&#xA;least the&#xA;&quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.&#xA;&lt;one line to give the library&apos;s name and a brief idea of what&#xA;it does.&gt;&#xA;Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;&#xA;This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or&#xA;modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either&#xA;version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.&#xA;This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,&#xA;but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of&#xA;MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the&#xA;GNU&#xA;Lesser General Public License for more details.&#xA;You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software&#xA;Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307&#xA;USA&#xA;Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and&#xA;paper mail.&#xA;You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer)&#xA;or your&#xA;school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the library,&#xA;if&#xA;necessary.

By contrast, the GNU General&#xA;  Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share&#xA;  and change free software--to make sure the software is free for&#xA;  all its users.&#xA;&#xA;  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some&#xA;  specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of&#xA;  the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use&#xA;  it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully&#xA;  about whether this license or the ordinary General Public&#xA;  License is the better strategy to use in any particular case,&#xA;  based on the explanations below.&#xA;&#xA;  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of&#xA;  use, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make&#xA;  sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free&#xA;  software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you&#xA;  receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can&#xA;  change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs;&#xA;  and that you are informed that you can do these things.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid&#xA;  distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender&#xA;  these rights. These restrictions translate to certain&#xA;  responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library&#xA;  or if you modify it.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether&#xA;  gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights&#xA;  that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or&#xA;  can get the source code. If you link other code with the&#xA;  library, you must provide complete object files to the&#xA;  recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after&#xA;  making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must&#xA;  show them these terms so they know their rights.&#xA;&#xA;  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright&#xA;  the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you&#xA;  legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that&#xA;  there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library&#xA;  is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should&#xA;  know that what they have is not the original version, so that&#xA;  the original author&apos;s reputation will not be affected by&#xA;  problems that might be introduced by others.&#xA;&#xA;  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the&#xA;  existence of any free program. We wish to make sure that a&#xA;  company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program&#xA;  by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder.&#xA;  Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a&#xA;  version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom&#xA;  of use specified in this license.&#xA;&#xA;  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the&#xA;  ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU&#xA;  Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated&#xA;  libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General&#xA;  Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in&#xA;  order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.&#xA;&#xA;  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or&#xA;  using a shared library, the combination of the two is legally&#xA;  speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library.&#xA;  The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such&#xA;  linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of&#xA;  freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax&#xA;  criteria for linking other code with the library.&#xA;&#xA;  We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public&#xA;  License because it does Less to protect the user&apos;s freedom&#xA;  than the ordinary General Public License. It also provides other&#xA;  free software developers Less of an advantage over competing&#xA;  non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the&#xA;  ordinary General Public License for many libraries. However, the&#xA;  Lesser license provides advantages in certain special&#xA;  circumstances.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to&#xA;  encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that&#xA;  it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free&#xA;  programs must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent&#xA;  case is that a free library does the same job as widely used&#xA;  non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by&#xA;  limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the&#xA;  Lesser General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in&#xA;  non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a&#xA;  large body of free software. For example, permission to use the&#xA;  GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to&#xA;  use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the&#xA;  GNU/Linux operating system.&#xA;&#xA;  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of&#xA;  the users&apos; freedom, it does ensure that the user of a&#xA;  program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the&#xA;  wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the&#xA;  Library.&#xA;&#xA;  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;  modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference&#xA;  between a &quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work&#xA;  that uses the library&quot;. The former contains code derived&#xA;  from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the&#xA;  library in order to run.&#xA;&#xA;  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR&#xA;  COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION&#xA;&#xA;  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or&#xA;  other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright&#xA;  holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed&#xA;  under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also&#xA;  called &quot;this License&quot;). Each licensee is addressed as&#xA;  &quot;you&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions&#xA;  and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with&#xA;  application programs (which use some of those functions and&#xA;  data) to form executables.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software&#xA;  library or work which has been distributed under these terms. A&#xA;  &quot;work based on the Library&quot; means either the Library&#xA;  or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a&#xA;  work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim&#xA;  or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into&#xA;  another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without&#xA;  limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of&#xA;  the work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete&#xA;  source code means all the source code for all modules it&#xA;  contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus&#xA;  the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the&#xA;  library.&#xA;&#xA;  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are&#xA;  not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act&#xA;  of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and&#xA;  output from such a program is covered only if its contents&#xA;  constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use&#xA;  of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true&#xA;  depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses&#xA;  the Library does.&#xA;&#xA;  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the&#xA;  Library&apos;s complete source code as you receive it, in any&#xA;  medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately&#xA;  publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and&#xA;  disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer&#xA;  to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and&#xA;  distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.&#xA;&#xA;  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a&#xA;  copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in&#xA;  exchange for a fee.&#xA;&#xA;  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any&#xA;  portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and&#xA;  copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms&#xA;  of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these&#xA;  conditions:&#xA;&#xA;  a) The modified work must itself be a software library.&#xA;&#xA;  b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices&#xA;  stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.&#xA;&#xA;  c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no&#xA;  charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or&#xA;  a table of data to be supplied by an application program that&#xA;  uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the&#xA;  facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to&#xA;  ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such&#xA;  function or table, the facility still operates, and performs&#xA;  whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.&#xA;&#xA;  (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots&#xA;  has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the&#xA;  application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any&#xA;  application-supplied function or table used by this function&#xA;  must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the&#xA;  square root function must still compute square roots.)&#xA;&#xA;  These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If&#xA;  identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the&#xA;  Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and&#xA;  separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms,&#xA;  do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as&#xA;  separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as&#xA;  part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the&#xA;  distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License,&#xA;  whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire&#xA;  whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote&#xA;  it.&#xA;&#xA;  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or&#xA;  contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the&#xA;  intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of&#xA;  derivative or collective works based on the Library.&#xA;&#xA;  In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the&#xA;  Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library)&#xA;  on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring&#xA;  the other work under the scope of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General&#xA;  Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the&#xA;  Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer&#xA;  to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General&#xA;  Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a&#xA;  newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public&#xA;  License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead&#xA;  if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.&#xA;&#xA;  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for&#xA;  that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to&#xA;  all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.&#xA;&#xA;  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of&#xA;  the Library into a program that is not a library.&#xA;&#xA;  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or&#xA;  derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable&#xA;  form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you&#xA;  accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable&#xA;  source code, which must be distributed under the terms of&#xA;  Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software&#xA;  interchange.&#xA;&#xA;  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to&#xA;  copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to&#xA;  copy the source code from the same place satisfies the&#xA;  requirement to distribute the source code, even though third&#xA;  parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the&#xA;  object code.&#xA;&#xA;  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the&#xA;  Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being&#xA;  compiled or linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the&#xA;  Library&quot;. Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative&#xA;  work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of&#xA;  this License.&#xA;&#xA;  However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with&#xA;  the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the&#xA;  Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather&#xA;  than a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;. The executable is&#xA;  therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for&#xA;  distribution of such executables.&#xA;&#xA;  When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from&#xA;  a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for&#xA;  the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the&#xA;  source code is not. Whether this is true is especially&#xA;  significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if&#xA;  the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true&#xA;  is not precisely defined by law.&#xA;&#xA;  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data&#xA;  structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small&#xA;  inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of&#xA;  the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is&#xA;  legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object&#xA;  code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section&#xA;  6.)&#xA;&#xA;  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may&#xA;  distribute the object code for the work under the terms of&#xA;  Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under&#xA;  Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the&#xA;  Library itself.&#xA;&#xA;  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine&#xA;  or link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the&#xA;  Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library,&#xA;  and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided&#xA;  that the terms permit modification of the work for the&#xA;  customer&apos;s own use and reverse engineering for debugging&#xA;  such modifications.&#xA;&#xA;  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that&#xA;  the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are&#xA;  covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License.&#xA;  If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you&#xA;  must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as&#xA;  well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this&#xA;  License. Also, you must do one of these things:&#xA;&#xA;  a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding&#xA;  machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever&#xA;  changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under&#xA;  Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable&#xA;  linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable&#xA;  &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or&#xA;  source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then&#xA;  relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified&#xA;  Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the&#xA;  contents of definitions files in the Library will not&#xA;  necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the&#xA;  modified definitions.)&#xA;&#xA;  b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the&#xA;  Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a&#xA;  copy of the library already present on the user&apos;s computer&#xA;  system, rather than copying library functions into the&#xA;  executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified&#xA;  version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the&#xA;  modified version is interface-compatible with the version that&#xA;  the work was made with.&#xA;&#xA;  c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least&#xA;  three years, to give the same user the materials specified in&#xA;  Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of&#xA;  performing this distribution.&#xA;&#xA;  d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to&#xA;  copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy&#xA;  the above specified materials from the same place.&#xA;&#xA;  e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these&#xA;  materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.&#xA;&#xA;  For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses&#xA;  the Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs&#xA;  needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a&#xA;  special exception, the materials to be distributed need not&#xA;  include anything that is normally distributed (in either source&#xA;  or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and&#xA;  so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs,&#xA;  unless that component itself accompanies the executable.&#xA;&#xA;  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license&#xA;  restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally&#xA;  accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you&#xA;  cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable&#xA;  that you distribute.&#xA;&#xA;  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the&#xA;  Library side-by-side in a single library together with other&#xA;  library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute&#xA;  such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution&#xA;  of the work based on the Library and of the other library&#xA;  facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do&#xA;  these two things:&#xA;&#xA;  a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work&#xA;  based on the Library, uncombined with any other library&#xA;  facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the&#xA;  Sections above.&#xA;&#xA;  b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact&#xA;  that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining&#xA;  where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.&#xA;&#xA;  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or&#xA;  distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this&#xA;  License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link&#xA;  with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically&#xA;  terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who&#xA;  have received copies, or rights, from you under this License&#xA;  will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties&#xA;  remain in full compliance.&#xA;&#xA;  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have&#xA;  not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to&#xA;  modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These&#xA;  actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.&#xA;  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work&#xA;  based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this&#xA;  License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,&#xA;  distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.&#xA;&#xA;  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on&#xA;  the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license&#xA;  from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or&#xA;  modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You&#xA;  may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients&apos;&#xA;  exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible&#xA;  for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.&#xA;&#xA;  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of&#xA;  patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to&#xA;  patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court&#xA;  order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of&#xA;  this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this&#xA;  License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy&#xA;  simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other&#xA;  pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not&#xA;  distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license&#xA;  would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by&#xA;  all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you,&#xA;  then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License&#xA;  would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.&#xA;&#xA;  If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable&#xA;  under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is&#xA;  intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to&#xA;  apply in other circumstances.&#xA;&#xA;  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe&#xA;  any patents or other property right claims or to contest&#xA;  validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose&#xA;  of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution&#xA;  system which is implemented by public license practices. Many&#xA;  people have made generous contributions to the wide range of&#xA;  software distributed through that system in reliance on&#xA;  consistent application of that system; it is up to the&#xA;  author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute&#xA;  software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose&#xA;  that choice.&#xA;&#xA;  This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is&#xA;  believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted&#xA;  in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted&#xA;  interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library&#xA;  under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution&#xA;  limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is&#xA;  permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such&#xA;  case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in&#xA;  the body of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new&#xA;  versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.&#xA;  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present&#xA;  version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or&#xA;  concerns.&#xA;&#xA;  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the&#xA;  Library specifies a version number of this License which applies&#xA;  to it and &quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of&#xA;  following the terms and conditions either of that version or of&#xA;  any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If&#xA;  the Library does not specify a license version number, you may&#xA;  choose any version ever published by the Free Software&#xA;  Foundation.&#xA;&#xA;  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other&#xA;  free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible&#xA;  with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For&#xA;  software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation,&#xA;  write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make&#xA;  exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two&#xA;  goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our&#xA;  free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software&#xA;  generally.&#xA;&#xA;  NO WARRANTY&#xA;&#xA;  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO&#xA;  WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE&#xA;  LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT&#xA;  HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS&#xA;  IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR&#xA;  IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES&#xA;  OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE&#xA;  ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS&#xA;  WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE&#xA;  COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;&#xA;  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO&#xA;  IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY&#xA;  MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE&#xA;  LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,&#xA;  INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR&#xA;  INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS&#xA;  OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY&#xA;  YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH&#xA;  ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN&#xA;  ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;  END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;&#xA;  How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries&#xA;&#xA;  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the&#xA;  greatest possible use to the public, we recommend making it free&#xA;  software that everyone can redistribute and change. You can do&#xA;  so by permitting redistribution under these terms (or,&#xA;  alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public&#xA;  License).&#xA;&#xA;  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the&#xA;  library. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source&#xA;  file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and&#xA;  each file should have at least the &quot;copyright&quot; line&#xA;  and a pointer to where the full notice is found.&#xA;&#xA;  &lt;one line to give the library&apos;s name and a brief idea of&#xA;  what it does.&gt; Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt; &lt;name of&#xA;  author&gt;&#xA;&#xA;  This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or&#xA;  modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;  License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either&#xA;  version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later&#xA;  version.&#xA;&#xA;  This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,&#xA;  but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of&#xA;  MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU&#xA;  Lesser General Public License for more details.&#xA;&#xA;  You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;  License along with this library; if not, write to the Free&#xA;  Software Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston,&#xA;  MA 02111-1307 USA&#xA;&#xA;  Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and&#xA;  paper mail.&#xA;&#xA;  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer)&#xA;  or your school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright&#xA;  disclaimer&quot; for the library, if necessary. Here is a&#xA;  sample; alter the names:&#xA;&#xA;  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the&#xA;  library `Frob&apos; (a library for tweaking knobs) written by&#xA;  James Random Hacker.&#xA;&#xA;  &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1990 Ty Coon, President of&#xA;  Vice&#xA;&#xA;  That&apos;s all there is to it!

          GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 2.1, February 1999&#xA;&#xA;  Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 59&#xA;  Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA Everyone is&#xA;  permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license&#xA;  document, but changing it is not allowed.&#xA;&#xA;  [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also&#xA;  counts as the successor of the GNU Library Public License,&#xA;  version 2, hence the version number 2.1.]&#xA;&#xA;  Preamble&#xA;&#xA;  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your&#xA;  freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General&#xA;  Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share&#xA;  and change free software--to make sure the software is free for&#xA;  all its users.&#xA;&#xA;  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some&#xA;  specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of&#xA;  the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use&#xA;  it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully&#xA;  about whether this license or the ordinary General Public&#xA;  License is the better strategy to use in any particular case,&#xA;  based on the explanations below.&#xA;&#xA;  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of&#xA;  use, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make&#xA;  sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free&#xA;  software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you&#xA;  receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can&#xA;  change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs;&#xA;  and that you are informed that you can do these things.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid&#xA;  distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender&#xA;  these rights. These restrictions translate to certain&#xA;  responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library&#xA;  or if you modify it.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether&#xA;  gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights&#xA;  that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or&#xA;  can get the source code. If you link other code with the&#xA;  library, you must provide complete object files to the&#xA;  recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after&#xA;  making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must&#xA;  show them these terms so they know their rights.&#xA;&#xA;  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright&#xA;  the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you&#xA;  legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that&#xA;  there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library&#xA;  is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should&#xA;  know that what they have is not the original version, so that&#xA;  the original author&apos;s reputation will not be affected by&#xA;  problems that might be introduced by others.&#xA;&#xA;  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the&#xA;  existence of any free program. We wish to make sure that a&#xA;  company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program&#xA;  by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder.&#xA;  Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a&#xA;  version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom&#xA;  of use specified in this license.&#xA;&#xA;  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the&#xA;  ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU&#xA;  Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated&#xA;  libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General&#xA;  Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in&#xA;  order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.&#xA;&#xA;  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or&#xA;  using a shared library, the combination of the two is legally&#xA;  speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library.&#xA;  The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such&#xA;  linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of&#xA;  freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax&#xA;  criteria for linking other code with the library.&#xA;&#xA;  We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public&#xA;  License because it does Less to protect the user&apos;s freedom&#xA;  than the ordinary General Public License. It also provides other&#xA;  free software developers Less of an advantage over competing&#xA;  non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the&#xA;  ordinary General Public License for many libraries. However, the&#xA;  Lesser license provides advantages in certain special&#xA;  circumstances.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to&#xA;  encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that&#xA;  it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free&#xA;  programs must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent&#xA;  case is that a free library does the same job as widely used&#xA;  non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by&#xA;  limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the&#xA;  Lesser General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in&#xA;  non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a&#xA;  large body of free software. For example, permission to use the&#xA;  GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to&#xA;  use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the&#xA;  GNU/Linux operating system.&#xA;&#xA;  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of&#xA;  the users&apos; freedom, it does ensure that the user of a&#xA;  program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the&#xA;  wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the&#xA;  Library.&#xA;&#xA;  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;  modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference&#xA;  between a &quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work&#xA;  that uses the library&quot;. The former contains code derived&#xA;  from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the&#xA;  library in order to run.&#xA;&#xA;  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR&#xA;  COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION&#xA;&#xA;  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or&#xA;  other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright&#xA;  holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed&#xA;  under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also&#xA;  called &quot;this License&quot;). Each licensee is addressed as&#xA;  &quot;you&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions&#xA;  and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with&#xA;  application programs (which use some of those functions and&#xA;  data) to form executables.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software&#xA;  library or work which has been distributed under these terms. A&#xA;  &quot;work based on the Library&quot; means either the Library&#xA;  or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a&#xA;  work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim&#xA;  or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into&#xA;  another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without&#xA;  limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of&#xA;  the work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete&#xA;  source code means all the source code for all modules it&#xA;  contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus&#xA;  the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the&#xA;  library.&#xA;&#xA;  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are&#xA;  not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act&#xA;  of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and&#xA;  output from such a program is covered only if its contents&#xA;  constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use&#xA;  of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true&#xA;  depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses&#xA;  the Library does.&#xA;&#xA;  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the&#xA;  Library&apos;s complete source code as you receive it, in any&#xA;  medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately&#xA;  publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and&#xA;  disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer&#xA;  to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and&#xA;  distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.&#xA;&#xA;  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a&#xA;  copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in&#xA;  exchange for a fee.&#xA;&#xA;  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any&#xA;  portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and&#xA;  copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms&#xA;  of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these&#xA;  conditions:&#xA;&#xA;  a) The modified work must itself be a software library.&#xA;&#xA;  b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices&#xA;  stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.&#xA;&#xA;  c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no&#xA;  charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or&#xA;  a table of data to be supplied by an application program that&#xA;  uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the&#xA;  facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to&#xA;  ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such&#xA;  function or table, the facility still operates, and performs&#xA;  whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.&#xA;&#xA;  (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots&#xA;  has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the&#xA;  application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any&#xA;  application-supplied function or table used by this function&#xA;  must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the&#xA;  square root function must still compute square roots.)&#xA;&#xA;  These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If&#xA;  identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the&#xA;  Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and&#xA;  separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms,&#xA;  do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as&#xA;  separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as&#xA;  part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the&#xA;  distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License,&#xA;  whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire&#xA;  whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote&#xA;  it.&#xA;&#xA;  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or&#xA;  contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the&#xA;  intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of&#xA;  derivative or collective works based on the Library.&#xA;&#xA;  In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the&#xA;  Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library)&#xA;  on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring&#xA;  the other work under the scope of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General&#xA;  Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the&#xA;  Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer&#xA;  to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General&#xA;  Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a&#xA;  newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public&#xA;  License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead&#xA;  if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.&#xA;&#xA;  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for&#xA;  that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to&#xA;  all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.&#xA;&#xA;  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of&#xA;  the Library into a program that is not a library.&#xA;&#xA;  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or&#xA;  derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable&#xA;  form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you&#xA;  accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable&#xA;  source code, which must be distributed under the terms of&#xA;  Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software&#xA;  interchange.&#xA;&#xA;  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to&#xA;  copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to&#xA;  copy the source code from the same place satisfies the&#xA;  requirement to distribute the source code, even though third&#xA;  parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the&#xA;  object code.&#xA;&#xA;  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the&#xA;  Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being&#xA;  compiled or linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the&#xA;  Library&quot;. Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative&#xA;  work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of&#xA;  this License.&#xA;&#xA;  However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with&#xA;  the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the&#xA;  Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather&#xA;  than a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;. The executable is&#xA;  therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for&#xA;  distribution of such executables.&#xA;&#xA;  When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from&#xA;  a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for&#xA;  the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the&#xA;  source code is not. Whether this is true is especially&#xA;  significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if&#xA;  the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true&#xA;  is not precisely defined by law.&#xA;&#xA;  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data&#xA;  structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small&#xA;  inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of&#xA;  the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is&#xA;  legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object&#xA;  code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section&#xA;  6.)&#xA;&#xA;  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may&#xA;  distribute the object code for the work under the terms of&#xA;  Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under&#xA;  Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the&#xA;  Library itself.&#xA;&#xA;  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine&#xA;  or link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the&#xA;  Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library,&#xA;  and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided&#xA;  that the terms permit modification of the work for the&#xA;  customer&apos;s own use and reverse engineering for debugging&#xA;  such modifications.&#xA;&#xA;  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that&#xA;  the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are&#xA;  covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License.&#xA;  If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you&#xA;  must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as&#xA;  well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this&#xA;  License. Also, you must do one of these things:&#xA;&#xA;  a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding&#xA;  machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever&#xA;  changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under&#xA;  Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable&#xA;  linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable&#xA;  &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or&#xA;  source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then&#xA;  relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified&#xA;  Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the&#xA;  contents of definitions files in the Library will not&#xA;  necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the&#xA;  modified definitions.)&#xA;&#xA;  b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the&#xA;  Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a&#xA;  copy of the library already present on the user&apos;s computer&#xA;  system, rather than copying library functions into the&#xA;  executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified&#xA;  version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the&#xA;  modified version is interface-compatible with the version that&#xA;  the work was made with.&#xA;&#xA;  c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least&#xA;  three years, to give the same user the materials specified in&#xA;  Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of&#xA;  performing this distribution.&#xA;&#xA;  d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to&#xA;  copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy&#xA;  the above specified materials from the same place.&#xA;&#xA;  e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these&#xA;  materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.&#xA;&#xA;  For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses&#xA;  the Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs&#xA;  needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a&#xA;  special exception, the materials to be distributed need not&#xA;  include anything that is normally distributed (in either source&#xA;  or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and&#xA;  so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs,&#xA;  unless that component itself accompanies the executable.&#xA;&#xA;  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license&#xA;  restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally&#xA;  accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you&#xA;  cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable&#xA;  that you distribute.&#xA;&#xA;  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the&#xA;  Library side-by-side in a single library together with other&#xA;  library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute&#xA;  such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution&#xA;  of the work based on the Library and of the other library&#xA;  facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do&#xA;  these two things:&#xA;&#xA;  a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work&#xA;  based on the Library, uncombined with any other library&#xA;  facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the&#xA;  Sections above.&#xA;&#xA;  b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact&#xA;  that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining&#xA;  where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.&#xA;&#xA;  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or&#xA;  distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this&#xA;  License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link&#xA;  with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically&#xA;  terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who&#xA;  have received copies, or rights, from you under this License&#xA;  will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties&#xA;  remain in full compliance.&#xA;&#xA;  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have&#xA;  not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to&#xA;  modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These&#xA;  actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.&#xA;  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work&#xA;  based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this&#xA;  License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,&#xA;  distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.&#xA;&#xA;  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on&#xA;  the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license&#xA;  from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or&#xA;  modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You&#xA;  may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients&apos;&#xA;  exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible&#xA;  for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.&#xA;&#xA;  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of&#xA;  patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to&#xA;  patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court&#xA;  order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of&#xA;  this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this&#xA;  License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy&#xA;  simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other&#xA;  pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not&#xA;  distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license&#xA;  would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by&#xA;  all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you,&#xA;  then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License&#xA;  would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.&#xA;&#xA;  If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable&#xA;  under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is&#xA;  intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to&#xA;  apply in other circumstances.&#xA;&#xA;  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe&#xA;  any patents or other property right claims or to contest&#xA;  validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose&#xA;  of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution&#xA;  system which is implemented by public license practices. Many&#xA;  people have made generous contributions to the wide range of&#xA;  software distributed through that system in reliance on&#xA;  consistent application of that system; it is up to the&#xA;  author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute&#xA;  software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose&#xA;  that choice.&#xA;&#xA;  This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is&#xA;  believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted&#xA;  in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted&#xA;  interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library&#xA;  under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution&#xA;  limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is&#xA;  permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such&#xA;  case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in&#xA;  the body of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new&#xA;  versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.&#xA;  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present&#xA;  version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or&#xA;  concerns.&#xA;&#xA;  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the&#xA;  Library specifies a version number of this License which applies&#xA;  to it and &quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of&#xA;  following the terms and conditions either of that version or of&#xA;  any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If&#xA;  the Library does not specify a license version number, you may&#xA;  choose any version ever published by the Free Software&#xA;  Foundation.&#xA;&#xA;  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other&#xA;  free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible&#xA;  with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For&#xA;  software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation,&#xA;  write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make&#xA;  exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two&#xA;  goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our&#xA;  free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software&#xA;  generally.&#xA;&#xA;  NO WARRANTY&#xA;&#xA;  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO&#xA;  WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE&#xA;  LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT&#xA;  HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS&#xA;  IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR&#xA;  IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES&#xA;  OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE&#xA;  ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS&#xA;  WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE&#xA;  COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;&#xA;  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO&#xA;  IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY&#xA;  MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE&#xA;  LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,&#xA;  INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR&#xA;  INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS&#xA;  OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY&#xA;  YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH&#xA;  ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN&#xA;  ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;  END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;&#xA;  How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries&#xA;&#xA;  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the&#xA;  greatest possible use to the public, we recommend making it free&#xA;  software that everyone can redistribute and change. You can do&#xA;  so by permitting redistribution under these terms (or,&#xA;  alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public&#xA;  License).&#xA;&#xA;  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the&#xA;  library. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source&#xA;  file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and&#xA;  each file should have at least the &quot;copyright&quot; line&#xA;  and a pointer to where the full notice is found.&#xA;&#xA;  &lt;one line to give the library&apos;s name and a brief idea of&#xA;  what it does.&gt; Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt; &lt;name of&#xA;  author&gt;&#xA;&#xA;  This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or&#xA;  modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;  License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either&#xA;  version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later&#xA;  version.&#xA;&#xA;  This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,&#xA;  but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of&#xA;  MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

          GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;         Version 2.1, February 1999&#xA;&#xA; Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.&#xA;     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA&#xA; Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies&#xA; of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.&#xA;&#xA;[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts&#xA; as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence&#xA; the version number 2.1.]&#xA;&#xA;       Preamble&#xA;&#xA;  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your&#xA;freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public&#xA;Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change&#xA;free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.&#xA;&#xA;  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some&#xA;specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the&#xA;Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You&#xA;can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether&#xA;this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better&#xA;strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.&#xA;&#xA;  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,&#xA;not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that&#xA;you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge&#xA;for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get&#xA;it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of&#xA;it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do&#xA;these things.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid&#xA;distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these&#xA;rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for&#xA;you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis&#xA;or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave&#xA;you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source&#xA;code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide&#xA;complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them&#xA;with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling&#xA;it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.&#xA;&#xA;  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the&#xA;library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal&#xA;permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that&#xA;there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is&#xA;modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know&#xA;that what they have is not the original version, so that the original&#xA;author&apos;s reputation will not be affected by problems that might be&#xA;introduced by others.&#xA;&#xA;  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of&#xA;any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot&#xA;effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a&#xA;restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that&#xA;any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be&#xA;consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.&#xA;&#xA;  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the&#xA;ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser&#xA;General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and&#xA;is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use&#xA;this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those&#xA;libraries into non-free programs.&#xA;&#xA;  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using&#xA;a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a&#xA;combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary&#xA;General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the&#xA;entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General&#xA;Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with&#xA;the library.&#xA;&#xA;  We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because it&#xA;does Less to protect the user&apos;s freedom than the ordinary General&#xA;Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less&#xA;of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages&#xA;are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many&#xA;libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain&#xA;special circumstances.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to&#xA;encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes&#xA;a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be&#xA;allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free&#xA;library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this&#xA;case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free&#xA;software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free&#xA;programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of&#xA;free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in&#xA;non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU&#xA;operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating&#xA;system.&#xA;&#xA;  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the&#xA;users&apos; freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is&#xA;linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run&#xA;that program using a modified version of the Library.&#xA;&#xA;  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a&#xA;&quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;.  The&#xA;former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must&#xA;be combined with the library in order to run.&#xA;&#xA;    GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION&#xA;&#xA;  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other&#xA;program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or&#xA;other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of&#xA;this Lesser General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;).&#xA;Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data&#xA;prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs&#xA;(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work&#xA;which has been distributed under these terms.  A &quot;work based on the&#xA;Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under&#xA;copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a&#xA;portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated&#xA;straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is&#xA;included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for&#xA;making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means&#xA;all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated&#xA;interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation&#xA;and installation of the library.&#xA;&#xA;  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not&#xA;covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of&#xA;running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from&#xA;such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based&#xA;on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for&#xA;writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does&#xA;and what the program that uses the Library does.&#xA;  &#xA;  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library&apos;s&#xA;complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that&#xA;you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an&#xA;appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact&#xA;all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any&#xA;warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the&#xA;Library.&#xA;&#xA;  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,&#xA;and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a&#xA;fee.&#xA;&#xA;  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion&#xA;of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and&#xA;distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1&#xA;above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;&#xA;    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.&#xA;&#xA;    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices&#xA;    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.&#xA;&#xA;    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no&#xA;    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.&#xA;&#xA;    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a&#xA;    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses&#xA;    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility&#xA;    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,&#xA;    in the event an application does not supply such function or&#xA;    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of&#xA;    its purpose remains meaningful.&#xA;&#xA;    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has&#xA;    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the&#xA;    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any&#xA;    application-supplied function or table used by this function must&#xA;    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square&#xA;    root function must still compute square roots.)&#xA;&#xA;These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If&#xA;identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,&#xA;and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in&#xA;themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those&#xA;sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you&#xA;distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based&#xA;on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of&#xA;this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the&#xA;entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote&#xA;it.&#xA;&#xA;Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest&#xA;your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to&#xA;exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or&#xA;collective works based on the Library.&#xA;&#xA;In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library&#xA;with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of&#xA;a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under&#xA;the scope of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public&#xA;License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do&#xA;this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so&#xA;that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,&#xA;instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the&#xA;ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify&#xA;that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in&#xA;these notices.&#xA;&#xA;  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for&#xA;that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all&#xA;subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.&#xA;&#xA;  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of&#xA;the Library into a program that is not a library.&#xA;&#xA;  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or&#xA;derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form&#xA;under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany&#xA;it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which&#xA;must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a&#xA;medium customarily used for software interchange.&#xA;&#xA;  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy&#xA;from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the&#xA;source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to&#xA;distribute the source code, even though third parties are not&#xA;compelled to copy the source along with the object code.&#xA;&#xA;  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the&#xA;Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or&#xA;linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;.  Such a&#xA;work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and&#xA;therefore falls outside the scope of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library&#xA;creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it&#xA;contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses the&#xA;library&quot;.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.&#xA;Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.&#xA;&#xA;  When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header file&#xA;that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a&#xA;derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.&#xA;Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be&#xA;linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The&#xA;threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.&#xA;&#xA;  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data&#xA;structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline&#xA;functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object&#xA;file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative&#xA;work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the&#xA;Library will still fall under Section 6.)&#xA;&#xA;  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may&#xA;distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.&#xA;Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,&#xA;whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.&#xA;&#xA;  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or&#xA;link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce a&#xA;work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work&#xA;under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit&#xA;modification of the work for the customer&apos;s own use and reverse&#xA;engineering for debugging such modifications.&#xA;&#xA;  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the&#xA;Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by&#xA;this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work&#xA;during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the&#xA;copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference&#xA;directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one&#xA;of these things:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding&#xA;    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever&#xA;    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under&#xA;    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked&#xA;    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that&#xA;    uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that the&#xA;    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified&#xA;    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood&#xA;    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the&#xA;    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application&#xA;    to use the modified definitions.)&#xA;&#xA;    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the&#xA;    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a&#xA;    copy of the library already present on the user&apos;s computer system,&#xA;    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)&#xA;    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if&#xA;    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is&#xA;    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.&#xA;&#xA;    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at&#xA;    least three years, to give the same user the materials&#xA;    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more&#xA;    than the cost of performing this distribution.&#xA;&#xA;    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy&#xA;    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above&#xA;    specified materials from the same place.&#xA;&#xA;    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these&#xA;    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.&#xA;&#xA;  For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the&#xA;Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for&#xA;reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,&#xA;the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is&#xA;normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major&#xA;components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on&#xA;which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies&#xA;the executable.&#xA;&#xA;  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license&#xA;restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally&#xA;accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot&#xA;use both them and the Library together in an executable that you&#xA;distribute.&#xA;&#xA;  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the&#xA;Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library&#xA;facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined&#xA;library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on&#xA;the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise&#xA;permitted, and provided that you do these two things:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work&#xA;    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library&#xA;    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the&#xA;    Sections above.&#xA;&#xA;    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact&#xA;    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining&#xA;    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.&#xA;&#xA;  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute&#xA;the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any&#xA;attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or&#xA;distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your&#xA;rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,&#xA;or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses&#xA;terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.&#xA;&#xA;  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not&#xA;signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or&#xA;distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are&#xA;prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by&#xA;modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the&#xA;Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and&#xA;all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying&#xA;the Library or works based on it.&#xA;&#xA;  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the&#xA;Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the&#xA;original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library&#xA;subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further&#xA;restrictions on the recipients&apos; exercise of the rights granted herein.&#xA;You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with&#xA;this License.&#xA;&#xA;  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent&#xA;infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),&#xA;conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot&#xA;distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you&#xA;may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent&#xA;license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by&#xA;all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then&#xA;the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to&#xA;refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.&#xA;&#xA;If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any&#xA;particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,&#xA;and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.&#xA;&#xA;It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any&#xA;patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any&#xA;such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the&#xA;integrity of the free software distribution system which is&#xA;implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made&#xA;generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed&#xA;through that system in reliance on consistent application of that&#xA;system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing&#xA;to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot&#xA;impose that choice.&#xA;&#xA;This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to&#xA;be a consequence of the rest of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in&#xA;certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the&#xA;original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add&#xA;an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,&#xA;so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus&#xA;excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if&#xA;written in the body of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new&#xA;versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.&#xA;Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,&#xA;but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.&#xA;&#xA;Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library&#xA;specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and&#xA;&quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and&#xA;conditions either of that version or of any later version published by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a&#xA;license version number, you may choose any version ever published by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation.&#xA;&#xA;  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free&#xA;programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,&#xA;write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is&#xA;copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free&#xA;Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our&#xA;decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status&#xA;of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing&#xA;and reuse of software generally.&#xA;&#xA;       NO WARRANTY&#xA;&#xA;  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO&#xA;WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.&#xA;EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR&#xA;OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY&#xA;KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE&#xA;IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#xA;PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE&#xA;LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME&#xA;THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;&#xA;  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN&#xA;WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY&#xA;AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU&#xA;FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR&#xA;CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE&#xA;LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING&#xA;RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A&#xA;FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF&#xA;SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH&#xA;DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;       END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;&#xA;           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries&#xA;&#xA;  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest&#xA;possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that&#xA;everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting&#xA;redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the&#xA;ordinary General Public License).&#xA;&#xA;  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is&#xA;safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively&#xA;convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the&#xA;&quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.&#xA;&#xA;    &lt;one line to give the library&apos;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;&#xA;    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;&#xA;&#xA;    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or&#xA;    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either&#xA;    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.&#xA;&#xA;    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,&#xA;    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of&#xA;    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU&#xA;    Lesser General Public License for more details.&#xA;&#xA;    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software&#xA;    Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA&#xA;&#xA;Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.&#xA;&#xA;You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your&#xA;school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the library, if&#xA;necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:&#xA;&#xA;  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the&#xA;  library `Frob&apos; (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.&#xA;&#xA;  &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1990&#xA;  Ty Coon, President of Vice&#xA;&#xA;That&apos;s all there is to it!

          GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;         Version 2.1, February 1999&#xA;&#xA; Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.&#xA;     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA&#xA; Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies&#xA; of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.&#xA;&#xA;[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts&#xA; as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence&#xA; the version number 2.1.]&#xA;&#xA;       Preamble&#xA;&#xA;  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your&#xA;freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public&#xA;Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change&#xA;free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.&#xA;&#xA;  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some&#xA;specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the&#xA;Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You&#xA;can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether&#xA;this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better&#xA;strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.&#xA;&#xA;  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,&#xA;not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that&#xA;you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge&#xA;for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get&#xA;it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of&#xA;it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do&#xA;these things.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid&#xA;distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these&#xA;rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for&#xA;you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis&#xA;or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave&#xA;you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source&#xA;code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide&#xA;complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them&#xA;with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling&#xA;it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.&#xA;&#xA;  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the&#xA;library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal&#xA;permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that&#xA;there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is&#xA;modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know&#xA;that what they have is not the original version, so that the original&#xA;author&apos;s reputation will not be affected by problems that might be&#xA;introduced by others.&#xA;&#xA;  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of&#xA;any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot&#xA;effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a&#xA;restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that&#xA;any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be&#xA;consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.&#xA;&#xA;  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the&#xA;ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser&#xA;General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and&#xA;is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use&#xA;this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those&#xA;libraries into non-free programs.&#xA;&#xA;  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using&#xA;a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a&#xA;combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary&#xA;General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the&#xA;entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General&#xA;Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with&#xA;the library.&#xA;&#xA;  We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because it&#xA;does Less to protect the user&apos;s freedom than the ordinary General&#xA;Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less&#xA;of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages&#xA;are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many&#xA;libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain&#xA;special circumstances.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to&#xA;encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes&#xA;a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be&#xA;allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free&#xA;library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this&#xA;case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free&#xA;software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free&#xA;programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of&#xA;free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in&#xA;non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU&#xA;operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating&#xA;system.&#xA;&#xA;  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the&#xA;users&apos; freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is&#xA;linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run&#xA;that program using a modified version of the Library.&#xA;&#xA;  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a&#xA;&quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;.  The&#xA;former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must&#xA;be combined with the library in order to run.&#xA;&#xA;    GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION&#xA;&#xA;  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other&#xA;program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or&#xA;other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of&#xA;this Lesser General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;).&#xA;Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data&#xA;prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs&#xA;(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work&#xA;which has been distributed under these terms.  A &quot;work based on the&#xA;Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under&#xA;copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a&#xA;portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated&#xA;straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is&#xA;included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for&#xA;making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means&#xA;all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated&#xA;interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation&#xA;and installation of the library.&#xA;&#xA;  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not&#xA;covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of&#xA;running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from&#xA;such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based&#xA;on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for&#xA;writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does&#xA;and what the program that uses the Library does.&#xA;  &#xA;  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library&apos;s&#xA;complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that&#xA;you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an&#xA;appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact&#xA;all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any&#xA;warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the&#xA;Library.&#xA;&#xA;  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,&#xA;and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a&#xA;fee.&#xA;&#xA;  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion&#xA;of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and&#xA;distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1&#xA;above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;&#xA;    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.&#xA;&#xA;    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices&#xA;    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.&#xA;&#xA;    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no&#xA;    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.&#xA;&#xA;    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a&#xA;    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses&#xA;    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility&#xA;    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,&#xA;    in the event an application does not supply such function or&#xA;    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of&#xA;    its purpose remains meaningful.&#xA;&#xA;    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has&#xA;    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the&#xA;    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any&#xA;    application-supplied function or table used by this function must&#xA;    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square&#xA;    root function must still compute square roots.)&#xA;&#xA;These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If&#xA;identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,&#xA;and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in&#xA;themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those&#xA;sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you&#xA;distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based&#xA;on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of&#xA;this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the&#xA;entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote&#xA;it.&#xA;&#xA;Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest&#xA;your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to&#xA;exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or&#xA;collective works based on the Library.&#xA;&#xA;In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library&#xA;with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of&#xA;a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under&#xA;the scope of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public&#xA;License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do&#xA;this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so&#xA;that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,&#xA;instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the&#xA;ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify&#xA;that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in&#xA;these notices.&#xA;&#xA;  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for&#xA;that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all&#xA;subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.&#xA;&#xA;  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of&#xA;the Library into a program that is not a library.&#xA;&#xA;  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or&#xA;derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form&#xA;under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany&#xA;it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which&#xA;must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a&#xA;medium customarily used for software interchange.&#xA;&#xA;  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy&#xA;from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the&#xA;source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to&#xA;distribute the source code, even though third parties are not&#xA;compelled to copy the source along with the object code.&#xA;&#xA;  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the&#xA;Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or&#xA;linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;.  Such a&#xA;work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and&#xA;therefore falls outside the scope of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library&#xA;creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it&#xA;contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses the&#xA;library&quot;.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.&#xA;Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.&#xA;&#xA;  When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header file&#xA;that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a&#xA;derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.&#xA;Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be&#xA;linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The&#xA;threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.&#xA;&#xA;  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data&#xA;structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline&#xA;functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object&#xA;file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative&#xA;work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the&#xA;Library will still fall under Section 6.)&#xA;&#xA;  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may&#xA;distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.&#xA;Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,&#xA;whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.&#xA;&#xA;  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or&#xA;link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce a&#xA;work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work&#xA;under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit&#xA;modification of the work for the customer&apos;s own use and reverse&#xA;engineering for debugging such modifications.&#xA;&#xA;  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the&#xA;Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by&#xA;this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work&#xA;during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the&#xA;copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference&#xA;directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one&#xA;of these things:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding&#xA;    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever&#xA;    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under&#xA;    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked&#xA;    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that&#xA;    uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that the&#xA;    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified&#xA;    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood&#xA;    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the&#xA;    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application&#xA;    to use the modified definitions.)&#xA;&#xA;    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the&#xA;    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a&#xA;    copy of the library already present on the user&apos;s computer system,&#xA;    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)&#xA;    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if&#xA;    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is&#xA;    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.&#xA;&#xA;    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at&#xA;    least three years, to give the same user the materials&#xA;    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more&#xA;    than the cost of performing this distribution.&#xA;&#xA;    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy&#xA;    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above&#xA;    specified materials from the same place.&#xA;&#xA;    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these&#xA;    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.&#xA;&#xA;  For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the&#xA;Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for&#xA;reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,&#xA;the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is&#xA;normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major&#xA;components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on&#xA;which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies&#xA;the executable.&#xA;&#xA;  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license&#xA;restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally&#xA;accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot&#xA;use both them and the Library together in an executable that you&#xA;distribute.&#xA;&#xA;  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the&#xA;Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library&#xA;facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined&#xA;library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on&#xA;the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise&#xA;permitted, and provided that you do these two things:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work&#xA;    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library&#xA;    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the&#xA;    Sections above.&#xA;&#xA;    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact&#xA;    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining&#xA;    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.&#xA;&#xA;  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute&#xA;the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any&#xA;attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or&#xA;distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your&#xA;rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,&#xA;or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses&#xA;terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.&#xA;&#xA;  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not&#xA;signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or&#xA;distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are&#xA;prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by&#xA;modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the&#xA;Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and&#xA;all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying&#xA;the Library or works based on it.&#xA;&#xA;  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the&#xA;Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the&#xA;original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library&#xA;subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further&#xA;restrictions on the recipients&apos; exercise of the rights granted herein.&#xA;You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with&#xA;this License.&#xA;&#xA;  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent&#xA;infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),&#xA;conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot&#xA;distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you&#xA;may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent&#xA;license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by&#xA;all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then&#xA;the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to&#xA;refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.&#xA;&#xA;If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any&#xA;particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,&#xA;and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.&#xA;&#xA;It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any&#xA;patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any&#xA;such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the&#xA;integrity of the free software distribution system which is&#xA;implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made&#xA;generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed&#xA;through that system in reliance on consistent application of that&#xA;system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing&#xA;to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot&#xA;impose that choice.&#xA;&#xA;This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to&#xA;be a consequence of the rest of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in&#xA;certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the&#xA;original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add&#xA;an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,&#xA;so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus&#xA;excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if&#xA;written in the body of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new&#xA;versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.&#xA;Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,&#xA;but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.&#xA;&#xA;Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library&#xA;specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and&#xA;&quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and&#xA;conditions either of that version or of any later version published by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a&#xA;license version number, you may choose any version ever published by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation.&#xA;&#xA;  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free&#xA;programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,&#xA;write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is&#xA;copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free&#xA;Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our&#xA;decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status&#xA;of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing&#xA;and reuse of software generally.&#xA;&#xA;       NO WARRANTY&#xA;&#xA;  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO&#xA;WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.&#xA;EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR&#xA;OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY&#xA;KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE&#xA;IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#xA;PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE&#xA;LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME&#xA;THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;&#xA;  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN&#xA;WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY&#xA;AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU&#xA;FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR&#xA;CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE&#xA;LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING&#xA;RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A&#xA;FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF&#xA;SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH&#xA;DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;       END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;&#xA;           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries&#xA;&#xA;  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest&#xA;possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that&#xA;everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting&#xA;redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the&#xA;ordinary General Public License).&#xA;&#xA;  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is&#xA;safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively&#xA;convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the&#xA;&quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.&#xA;&#xA;    &lt;one line to give the library&apos;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;&#xA;    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;&#xA;&#xA;    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or&#xA;    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either&#xA;    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.&#xA;&#xA;    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,&#xA;    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of&#xA;    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU&#xA;    Lesser General Public License for more details.&#xA;&#xA;    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software&#xA;    Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA&#xA;&#xA;Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.&#xA;&#xA;You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your&#xA;school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the library, if&#xA;necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:&#xA;&#xA;  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the&#xA;  library `Frob&apos; (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.&#xA;&#xA;  &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1990&#xA;  Ty Coon, President of Vice&#xA;&#xA;That&apos;s all there is to it!

          GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;         Version 2.1, February 1999&#xA;&#xA; Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.&#xA;     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA&#xA; Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies&#xA; of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.&#xA;&#xA;[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts&#xA; as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence&#xA; the version number 2.1.]&#xA;&#xA;       Preamble&#xA;&#xA;  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your&#xA;freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public&#xA;Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change&#xA;free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.&#xA;&#xA;  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some&#xA;specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the&#xA;Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You&#xA;can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether&#xA;this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better&#xA;strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.&#xA;&#xA;  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,&#xA;not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that&#xA;you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge&#xA;for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get&#xA;it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of&#xA;it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do&#xA;these things.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid&#xA;distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these&#xA;rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for&#xA;you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis&#xA;or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave&#xA;you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source&#xA;code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide&#xA;complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them&#xA;with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling&#xA;it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.&#xA;&#xA;  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the&#xA;library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal&#xA;permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that&#xA;there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is&#xA;modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know&#xA;that what they have is not the original version, so that the original&#xA;author&apos;s reputation will not be affected by problems that might be&#xA;introduced by others.&#xA;&#xA;  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of&#xA;any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot&#xA;effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a&#xA;restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that&#xA;any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be&#xA;consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.&#xA;&#xA;  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the&#xA;ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser&#xA;General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and&#xA;is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use&#xA;this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those&#xA;libraries into non-free programs.&#xA;&#xA;  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using&#xA;a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a&#xA;combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary&#xA;General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the&#xA;entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General&#xA;Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with&#xA;the library.&#xA;&#xA;  We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because it&#xA;does Less to protect the user&apos;s freedom than the ordinary General&#xA;Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less&#xA;of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages&#xA;are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many&#xA;libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain&#xA;special circumstances.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to&#xA;encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes&#xA;a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be&#xA;allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free&#xA;library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this&#xA;case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free&#xA;software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free&#xA;programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of&#xA;free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in&#xA;non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU&#xA;operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating&#xA;system.&#xA;&#xA;  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the&#xA;users&apos; freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is&#xA;linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run&#xA;that program using a modified version of the Library.&#xA;&#xA;  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a&#xA;&quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;.  The&#xA;former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must&#xA;be combined with the library in order to run.&#xA;&#xA;    GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION&#xA;&#xA;  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other&#xA;program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or&#xA;other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of&#xA;this Lesser General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;).&#xA;Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data&#xA;prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs&#xA;(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work&#xA;which has been distributed under these terms.  A &quot;work based on the&#xA;Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under&#xA;copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a&#xA;portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated&#xA;straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is&#xA;included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for&#xA;making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means&#xA;all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated&#xA;interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation&#xA;and installation of the library.&#xA;&#xA;  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not&#xA;covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of&#xA;running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from&#xA;such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based&#xA;on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for&#xA;writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does&#xA;and what the program that uses the Library does.&#xA;  &#xA;  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library&apos;s&#xA;complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that&#xA;you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an&#xA;appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact&#xA;all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any&#xA;warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the&#xA;Library.&#xA;&#xA;  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,&#xA;and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a&#xA;fee.&#xA;&#xA;  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion&#xA;of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and&#xA;distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1&#xA;above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;&#xA;    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.&#xA;&#xA;    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices&#xA;    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.&#xA;&#xA;    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no&#xA;    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.&#xA;&#xA;    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a&#xA;    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses&#xA;    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility&#xA;    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,&#xA;    in the event an application does not supply such function or&#xA;    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of&#xA;    its purpose remains meaningful.&#xA;&#xA;    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has&#xA;    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the&#xA;    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any&#xA;    application-supplied function or table used by this function must&#xA;    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square&#xA;    root function must still compute square roots.)&#xA;&#xA;These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If&#xA;identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,&#xA;and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in&#xA;themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those&#xA;sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you&#xA;distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based&#xA;on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of&#xA;this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the&#xA;entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote&#xA;it.&#xA;&#xA;Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest&#xA;your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to&#xA;exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or&#xA;collective works based on the Library.&#xA;&#xA;In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library&#xA;with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of&#xA;a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under&#xA;the scope of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public&#xA;License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do&#xA;this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so&#xA;that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,&#xA;instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the&#xA;ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify&#xA;that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in&#xA;these notices.&#xA;&#xA;  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for&#xA;that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all&#xA;subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.&#xA;&#xA;  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of&#xA;the Library into a program that is not a library.&#xA;&#xA;  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or&#xA;derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form&#xA;under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany&#xA;it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which&#xA;must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a&#xA;medium customarily used for software interchange.&#xA;&#xA;  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy&#xA;from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the&#xA;source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to&#xA;distribute the source code, even though third parties are not&#xA;compelled to copy the source along with the object code.&#xA;&#xA;  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the&#xA;Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or&#xA;linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;.  Such a&#xA;work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and&#xA;therefore falls outside the scope of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library&#xA;creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it&#xA;contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses the&#xA;library&quot;.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.&#xA;Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.&#xA;&#xA;  When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header file&#xA;that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a&#xA;derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.&#xA;Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be&#xA;linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The&#xA;threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.&#xA;&#xA;  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data&#xA;structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline&#xA;functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object&#xA;file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative&#xA;work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the&#xA;Library will still fall under Section 6.)&#xA;&#xA;  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may&#xA;distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.&#xA;Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,&#xA;whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.&#xA;&#xA;  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or&#xA;link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce a&#xA;work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work&#xA;under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit&#xA;modification of the work for the customer&apos;s own use and reverse&#xA;engineering for debugging such modifications.&#xA;&#xA;  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the&#xA;Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by&#xA;this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work&#xA;during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the&#xA;copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference&#xA;directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one&#xA;of these things:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding&#xA;    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever&#xA;    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under&#xA;    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked&#xA;    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that&#xA;    uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that the&#xA;    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified&#xA;    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood&#xA;    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the&#xA;    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application&#xA;    to use the modified definitions.)&#xA;&#xA;    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the&#xA;    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a&#xA;    copy of the library already present on the user&apos;s computer system,&#xA;    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)&#xA;    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if&#xA;    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is&#xA;    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.&#xA;&#xA;    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at&#xA;    least three years, to give the same user the materials&#xA;    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more&#xA;    than the cost of performing this distribution.&#xA;&#xA;    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy&#xA;    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above&#xA;    specified materials from the same place.&#xA;&#xA;    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these&#xA;    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.&#xA;&#xA;  For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the&#xA;Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for&#xA;reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,&#xA;the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is&#xA;normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major&#xA;components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on&#xA;which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies&#xA;the executable.&#xA;&#xA;  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license&#xA;restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally&#xA;accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot&#xA;use both them and the Library together in an executable that you&#xA;distribute.&#xA;&#xA;  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the&#xA;Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library&#xA;facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined&#xA;library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on&#xA;the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise&#xA;permitted, and provided that you do these two things:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work&#xA;    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library&#xA;    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the&#xA;    Sections above.&#xA;&#xA;    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact&#xA;    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining&#xA;    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.&#xA;&#xA;  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute&#xA;the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any&#xA;attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or&#xA;distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your&#xA;rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,&#xA;or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses&#xA;terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.&#xA;&#xA;  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not&#xA;signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or&#xA;distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are&#xA;prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by&#xA;modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the&#xA;Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and&#xA;all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying&#xA;the Library or works based on it.&#xA;&#xA;  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the&#xA;Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the&#xA;original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library&#xA;subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further&#xA;restrictions on the recipients&apos; exercise of the rights granted herein.&#xA;You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with&#xA;this License.&#xA;&#xA;  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent&#xA;infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),&#xA;conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot&#xA;distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you&#xA;may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent&#xA;license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by&#xA;all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then&#xA;the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to&#xA;refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.&#xA;&#xA;If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any&#xA;particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,&#xA;and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.&#xA;&#xA;It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any&#xA;patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any&#xA;such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the&#xA;integrity of the free software distribution system which is&#xA;implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made&#xA;generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed&#xA;through that system in reliance on consistent application of that&#xA;system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing&#xA;to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot&#xA;impose that choice.&#xA;&#xA;This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to&#xA;be a consequence of the rest of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in&#xA;certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the&#xA;original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add&#xA;an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,&#xA;so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus&#xA;excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if&#xA;written in the body of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new&#xA;versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.&#xA;Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,&#xA;but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.&#xA;&#xA;Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library&#xA;specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and&#xA;&quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and&#xA;conditions either of that version or of any later version published by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a&#xA;license version number, you may choose any version ever published by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation.&#xA;&#xA;  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free&#xA;programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,&#xA;write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is&#xA;copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free&#xA;Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our&#xA;decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status&#xA;of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing&#xA;and reuse of software generally.&#xA;&#xA;       NO WARRANTY&#xA;&#xA;  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO&#xA;WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.&#xA;EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR&#xA;OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY&#xA;KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE&#xA;IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#xA;PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE&#xA;LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME&#xA;THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;&#xA;  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN&#xA;WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY&#xA;AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU&#xA;FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR&#xA;CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE&#xA;LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING&#xA;RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A&#xA;FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF&#xA;SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH&#xA;DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;       END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;&#xA;           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries&#xA;&#xA;  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest&#xA;possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that&#xA;everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting&#xA;redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the&#xA;ordinary General Public License).&#xA;&#xA;  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is&#xA;safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively&#xA;convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the&#xA;&quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.&#xA;&#xA;    &lt;one line to give the library&apos;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;&#xA;    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;&#xA;&#xA;    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or&#xA;    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either&#xA;    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.&#xA;&#xA;    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,&#xA;    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of&#xA;    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU&#xA;    Lesser General Public License for more details.&#xA;&#xA;    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software&#xA;    Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA&#xA;&#xA;Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.&#xA;&#xA;You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your&#xA;school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the library, if&#xA;necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:&#xA;&#xA;  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the&#xA;  library `Frob&apos; (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.&#xA;&#xA;  &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1990&#xA;  Ty Coon, President of Vice&#xA;&#xA;That&apos;s all there is to it!

          GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;         Version 2.1, February 1999&#xA;&#xA; Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.&#xA;     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA&#xA; Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies&#xA; of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.&#xA;&#xA;[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts&#xA; as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence&#xA; the version number 2.1.]&#xA;&#xA;       Preamble&#xA;&#xA;  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your&#xA;freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public&#xA;Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change&#xA;free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.&#xA;&#xA;  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some&#xA;specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the&#xA;Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You&#xA;can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether&#xA;this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better&#xA;strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.&#xA;&#xA;  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,&#xA;not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that&#xA;you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge&#xA;for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get&#xA;it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of&#xA;it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do&#xA;these things.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid&#xA;distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these&#xA;rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for&#xA;you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis&#xA;or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave&#xA;you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source&#xA;code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide&#xA;complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them&#xA;with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling&#xA;it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.&#xA;&#xA;  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the&#xA;library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal&#xA;permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that&#xA;there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is&#xA;modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know&#xA;that what they have is not the original version, so that the original&#xA;author&apos;s reputation will not be affected by problems that might be&#xA;introduced by others.&#xA;&#xA;  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of&#xA;any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot&#xA;effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a&#xA;restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that&#xA;any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be&#xA;consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.&#xA;&#xA;  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the&#xA;ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser&#xA;General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and&#xA;is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use&#xA;this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those&#xA;libraries into non-free programs.&#xA;&#xA;  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using&#xA;a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a&#xA;combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary&#xA;General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the&#xA;entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General&#xA;Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with&#xA;the library.&#xA;&#xA;  We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because it&#xA;does Less to protect the user&apos;s freedom than the ordinary General&#xA;Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less&#xA;of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages&#xA;are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many&#xA;libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain&#xA;special circumstances.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to&#xA;encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes&#xA;a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be&#xA;allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free&#xA;library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this&#xA;case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free&#xA;software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free&#xA;programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of&#xA;free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in&#xA;non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU&#xA;operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating&#xA;system.&#xA;&#xA;  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the&#xA;users&apos; freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is&#xA;linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run&#xA;that program using a modified version of the Library.&#xA;&#xA;  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a&#xA;&quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;.  The&#xA;former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must&#xA;be combined with the library in order to run.&#xA;&#xA;    GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION&#xA;&#xA;  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other&#xA;program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or&#xA;other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of&#xA;this Lesser General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;).&#xA;Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data&#xA;prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs&#xA;(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work&#xA;which has been distributed under these terms.  A &quot;work based on the&#xA;Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under&#xA;copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a&#xA;portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated&#xA;straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is&#xA;included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for&#xA;making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means&#xA;all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated&#xA;interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation&#xA;and installation of the library.&#xA;&#xA;  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not&#xA;covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of&#xA;running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from&#xA;such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based&#xA;on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for&#xA;writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does&#xA;and what the program that uses the Library does.&#xA;  &#xA;  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library&apos;s&#xA;complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that&#xA;you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an&#xA;appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact&#xA;all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any&#xA;warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the&#xA;Library.&#xA;&#xA;  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,&#xA;and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a&#xA;fee.&#xA;&#xA;  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion&#xA;of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and&#xA;distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1&#xA;above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;&#xA;    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.&#xA;&#xA;    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices&#xA;    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.&#xA;&#xA;    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no&#xA;    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.&#xA;&#xA;    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a&#xA;    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses&#xA;    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility&#xA;    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,&#xA;    in the event an application does not supply such function or&#xA;    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of&#xA;    its purpose remains meaningful.&#xA;&#xA;    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has&#xA;    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the&#xA;    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any&#xA;    application-supplied function or table used by this function must&#xA;    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square&#xA;    root function must still compute square roots.)&#xA;&#xA;These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If&#xA;identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,&#xA;and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in&#xA;themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those&#xA;sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you&#xA;distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based&#xA;on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of&#xA;this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the&#xA;entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote&#xA;it.&#xA;&#xA;Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest&#xA;your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to&#xA;exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or&#xA;collective works based on the Library.&#xA;&#xA;In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library&#xA;with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of&#xA;a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under&#xA;the scope of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public&#xA;License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do&#xA;this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so&#xA;that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,&#xA;instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the&#xA;ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify&#xA;that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in&#xA;these notices.&#xA;&#xA;  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for&#xA;that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all&#xA;subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.&#xA;&#xA;  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of&#xA;the Library into a program that is not a library.&#xA;&#xA;  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or&#xA;derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form&#xA;under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany&#xA;it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which&#xA;must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a&#xA;medium customarily used for software interchange.&#xA;&#xA;  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy&#xA;from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the&#xA;source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to&#xA;distribute the source code, even though third parties are not&#xA;compelled to copy the source along with the object code.&#xA;&#xA;  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the&#xA;Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or&#xA;linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;.  Such a&#xA;work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and&#xA;therefore falls outside the scope of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library&#xA;creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it&#xA;contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses the&#xA;library&quot;.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.&#xA;Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.&#xA;&#xA;  When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header file&#xA;that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a&#xA;derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.&#xA;Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be&#xA;linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The&#xA;threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.&#xA;&#xA;  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data&#xA;structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline&#xA;functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object&#xA;file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative&#xA;work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the&#xA;Library will still fall under Section 6.)&#xA;&#xA;  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may&#xA;distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.&#xA;Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,&#xA;whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.&#xA;&#xA;  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or&#xA;link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce a&#xA;work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work&#xA;under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit&#xA;modification of the work for the customer&apos;s own use and reverse&#xA;engineering for debugging such modifications.&#xA;&#xA;  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the&#xA;Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by&#xA;this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work&#xA;during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the&#xA;copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference&#xA;directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one&#xA;of these things:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding&#xA;    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever&#xA;    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under&#xA;    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked&#xA;    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that&#xA;    uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that the&#xA;    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified&#xA;    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood&#xA;    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the&#xA;    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application&#xA;    to use the modified definitions.)&#xA;&#xA;    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the&#xA;    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a&#xA;    copy of the library already present on the user&apos;s computer system,&#xA;    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)&#xA;    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if&#xA;    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is&#xA;    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.&#xA;&#xA;    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at&#xA;    least three years, to give the same user the materials&#xA;    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more&#xA;    than the cost of performing this distribution.&#xA;&#xA;    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy&#xA;    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above&#xA;    specified materials from the same place.&#xA;&#xA;    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these&#xA;    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.&#xA;&#xA;  For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the&#xA;Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for&#xA;reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,&#xA;the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is&#xA;normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major&#xA;components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on&#xA;which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies&#xA;the executable.&#xA;&#xA;  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license&#xA;restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally&#xA;accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot&#xA;use both them and the Library together in an executable that you&#xA;distribute.&#xA;&#xA;  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the&#xA;Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library&#xA;facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined&#xA;library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on&#xA;the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise&#xA;permitted, and provided that you do these two things:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work&#xA;    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library&#xA;    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the&#xA;    Sections above.&#xA;&#xA;    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact&#xA;    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining&#xA;    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.&#xA;&#xA;  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute&#xA;the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any&#xA;attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or&#xA;distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your&#xA;rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,&#xA;or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses&#xA;terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.&#xA;&#xA;  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not&#xA;signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or&#xA;distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are&#xA;prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by&#xA;modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the&#xA;Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and&#xA;all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying&#xA;the Library or works based on it.&#xA;&#xA;  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the&#xA;Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the&#xA;original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library&#xA;subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further&#xA;restrictions on the recipients&apos; exercise of the rights granted herein.&#xA;You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with&#xA;this License.&#xA;&#xA;  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent&#xA;infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),&#xA;conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot&#xA;distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you&#xA;may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent&#xA;license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by&#xA;all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then&#xA;the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to&#xA;refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.&#xA;&#xA;If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any&#xA;particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,&#xA;and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.&#xA;&#xA;It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any&#xA;patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any&#xA;such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the&#xA;integrity of the free software distribution system which is&#xA;implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made&#xA;generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed&#xA;through that system in reliance on consistent application of that&#xA;system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing&#xA;to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot&#xA;impose that choice.&#xA;&#xA;This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to&#xA;be a consequence of the rest of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in&#xA;certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the&#xA;original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add&#xA;an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,&#xA;so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus&#xA;excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if&#xA;written in the body of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new&#xA;versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.&#xA;Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,&#xA;but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.&#xA;&#xA;Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library&#xA;specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and&#xA;&quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and&#xA;conditions either of that version or of any later version published by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a&#xA;license version number, you may choose any version ever published by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation.&#xA;&#xA;  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free&#xA;programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,&#xA;write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is&#xA;copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free&#xA;Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our&#xA;decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status&#xA;of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing&#xA;and reuse of software generally.&#xA;&#xA;       NO WARRANTY&#xA;&#xA;  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO&#xA;WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.&#xA;EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR&#xA;OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY&#xA;KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE&#xA;IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#xA;PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE&#xA;LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME&#xA;THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;&#xA;  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN&#xA;WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY&#xA;AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU&#xA;FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR&#xA;CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE&#xA;LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING&#xA;RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A&#xA;FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF&#xA;SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH&#xA;DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;       END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;&#xA;           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries&#xA;&#xA;  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest&#xA;possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that&#xA;everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting&#xA;redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the&#xA;ordinary General Public License).&#xA;&#xA;  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.

          GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 2.1, February 1999&#xA;&#xA;  Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 59&#xA;  Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA Everyone is&#xA;  permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license&#xA;  document, but changing it is not allowed.&#xA;&#xA;  [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also&#xA;  counts as the successor of the GNU Library Public License,&#xA;  version 2, hence the version number 2.1.]&#xA;&#xA;  Preamble&#xA;&#xA;  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your&#xA;  freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General&#xA;  Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share&#xA;  and change free software--to make sure the software is free for&#xA;  all its users.&#xA;&#xA;  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some&#xA;  specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of&#xA;  the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use&#xA;  it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully&#xA;  about whether this license or the ordinary General Public&#xA;  License is the better strategy to use in any particular case,&#xA;  based on the explanations below.&#xA;&#xA;  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of&#xA;  use, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make&#xA;  sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free&#xA;  software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you&#xA;  receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can&#xA;  change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs;&#xA;  and that you are informed that you can do these things.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid&#xA;  distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender&#xA;  these rights. These restrictions translate to certain&#xA;  responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library&#xA;  or if you modify it.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether&#xA;  gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights&#xA;  that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or&#xA;  can get the source code. If you link other code with the&#xA;  library, you must provide complete object files to the&#xA;  recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after&#xA;  making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must&#xA;  show them these terms so they know their rights.&#xA;&#xA;  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright&#xA;  the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you&#xA;  legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that&#xA;  there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library&#xA;  is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should&#xA;  know that what they have is not the original version, so that&#xA;  the original author&apos;s reputation will not be affected by&#xA;  problems that might be introduced by others.&#xA;&#xA;  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the&#xA;  existence of any free program. We wish to make sure that a&#xA;  company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program&#xA;  by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder.&#xA;  Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a&#xA;  version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom&#xA;  of use specified in this license.&#xA;&#xA;  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the&#xA;  ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU&#xA;  Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated&#xA;  libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General&#xA;  Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in&#xA;  order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.&#xA;&#xA;  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or&#xA;  using a shared library, the combination of the two is legally&#xA;  speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library.&#xA;  The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such&#xA;  linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of&#xA;  freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax&#xA;  criteria for linking other code with the library.&#xA;&#xA;  We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public&#xA;  License because it does Less to protect the user&apos;s freedom&#xA;  than the ordinary General Public License. It also provides other&#xA;  free software developers Less of an advantage over competing&#xA;  non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the&#xA;  ordinary General Public License for many libraries. However, the&#xA;  Lesser license provides advantages in certain special&#xA;  circumstances.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to&#xA;  encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that&#xA;  it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free&#xA;  programs must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent&#xA;  case is that a free library does the same job as widely used&#xA;  non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by&#xA;  limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the&#xA;  Lesser General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in&#xA;  non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a&#xA;  large body of free software. For example, permission to use the&#xA;  GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to&#xA;  use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the&#xA;  GNU/Linux operating system.&#xA;&#xA;  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of&#xA;  the users&apos; freedom, it does ensure that the user of a&#xA;  program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the&#xA;  wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the&#xA;  Library.&#xA;&#xA;  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;  modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference&#xA;  between a &quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work&#xA;  that uses the library&quot;. The former contains code derived&#xA;  from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the&#xA;  library in order to run.&#xA;&#xA;  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR&#xA;  COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION&#xA;&#xA;  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or&#xA;  other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright&#xA;  holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed&#xA;  under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also&#xA;  called &quot;this License&quot;). Each licensee is addressed as&#xA;  &quot;you&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions&#xA;  and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with&#xA;  application programs (which use some of those functions and&#xA;  data) to form executables.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software&#xA;  library or work which has been distributed under these terms. A&#xA;  &quot;work based on the Library&quot; means either the Library&#xA;  or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a&#xA;  work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim&#xA;  or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into&#xA;  another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without&#xA;  limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of&#xA;  the work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete&#xA;  source code means all the source code for all modules it&#xA;  contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus&#xA;  the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the&#xA;  library.&#xA;&#xA;  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are&#xA;  not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act&#xA;  of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and&#xA;  output from such a program is covered only if its contents&#xA;  constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use&#xA;  of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true&#xA;  depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses&#xA;  the Library does.&#xA;&#xA;  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the&#xA;  Library&apos;s complete source code as you receive it, in any&#xA;  medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately&#xA;  publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and&#xA;  disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer&#xA;  to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and&#xA;  distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.&#xA;&#xA;  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a&#xA;  copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in&#xA;  exchange for a fee.&#xA;&#xA;  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any&#xA;  portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and&#xA;  copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms&#xA;  of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these&#xA;  conditions:&#xA;&#xA;  a) The modified work must itself be a software library.&#xA;&#xA;  b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices&#xA;  stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.&#xA;&#xA;  c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no&#xA;  charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or&#xA;  a table of data to be supplied by an application program that&#xA;  uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the&#xA;  facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to&#xA;  ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such&#xA;  function or table, the facility still operates, and performs&#xA;  whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.&#xA;&#xA;  (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots&#xA;  has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the&#xA;  application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any&#xA;  application-supplied function or table used by this function&#xA;  must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the&#xA;  square root function must still compute square roots.)&#xA;&#xA;  These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If&#xA;  identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the&#xA;  Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and&#xA;  separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms,&#xA;  do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as&#xA;  separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as&#xA;  part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the&#xA;  distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License,&#xA;  whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire&#xA;  whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote&#xA;  it.&#xA;&#xA;  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or&#xA;  contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the&#xA;  intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of&#xA;  derivative or collective works based on the Library.&#xA;&#xA;  In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the&#xA;  Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library)&#xA;  on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring&#xA;  the other work under the scope of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General&#xA;  Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the&#xA;  Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer&#xA;  to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General&#xA;  Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a&#xA;  newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public&#xA;  License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead&#xA;  if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.&#xA;&#xA;  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for&#xA;  that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to&#xA;  all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.&#xA;&#xA;  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of&#xA;  the Library into a program that is not a library.&#xA;&#xA;  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or&#xA;  derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable&#xA;  form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you&#xA;  accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable&#xA;  source code, which must be distributed under the terms of&#xA;  Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software&#xA;  interchange.&#xA;&#xA;  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to&#xA;  copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to&#xA;  copy the source code from the same place satisfies the&#xA;  requirement to distribute the source code, even though third&#xA;  parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the&#xA;  object code.&#xA;&#xA;  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the&#xA;  Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being&#xA;  compiled or linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the&#xA;  Library&quot;. Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative&#xA;  work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of&#xA;  this License.&#xA;&#xA;  However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with&#xA;  the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the&#xA;  Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather&#xA;  than a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;. The executable is&#xA;  therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for&#xA;  distribution of such executables.&#xA;&#xA;  When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from&#xA;  a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for&#xA;  the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the&#xA;  source code is not. Whether this is true is especially&#xA;  significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if&#xA;  the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true&#xA;  is not precisely defined by law.&#xA;&#xA;  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data&#xA;  structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small&#xA;  inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of&#xA;  the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is&#xA;  legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object&#xA;  code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section&#xA;  6.)&#xA;&#xA;  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may&#xA;  distribute the object code for the work under the terms of&#xA;  Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under&#xA;  Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the&#xA;  Library itself.&#xA;&#xA;  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine&#xA;  or link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the&#xA;  Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library,&#xA;  and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided&#xA;  that the terms permit modification of the work for the&#xA;  customer&apos;s own use and reverse engineering for debugging&#xA;  such modifications.&#xA;&#xA;  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that&#xA;  the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are&#xA;  covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License.&#xA;  If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you&#xA;  must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as&#xA;  well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this&#xA;  License. Also, you must do one of these things:&#xA;&#xA;  a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding&#xA;  machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever&#xA;  changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under&#xA;  Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable&#xA;  linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable&#xA;  &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or&#xA;  source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then&#xA;  relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified&#xA;  Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the&#xA;  contents of definitions files in the Library will not&#xA;  necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the&#xA;  modified definitions.)&#xA;&#xA;  b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the&#xA;  Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a&#xA;  copy of the library already present on the user&apos;s computer&#xA;  system, rather than copying library functions into the&#xA;  executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified&#xA;  version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the&#xA;  modified version is interface-compatible with the version that&#xA;  the work was made with.&#xA;&#xA;  c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least&#xA;  three years, to give the same user the materials specified in&#xA;  Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of&#xA;  performing this distribution.&#xA;&#xA;  d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to&#xA;  copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy&#xA;  the above specified materials from the same place.&#xA;&#xA;  e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these&#xA;  materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.&#xA;&#xA;  For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses&#xA;  the Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs&#xA;  needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a&#xA;  special exception, the materials to be distributed need not&#xA;  include anything that is normally distributed (in either source&#xA;  or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and&#xA;  so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs,&#xA;  unless that component itself accompanies the executable.&#xA;&#xA;  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license&#xA;  restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally&#xA;  accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you&#xA;  cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable&#xA;  that you distribute.&#xA;&#xA;  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the&#xA;  Library side-by-side in a single library together with other&#xA;  library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute&#xA;  such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution&#xA;  of the work based on the Library and of the other library&#xA;  facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do&#xA;  these two things:&#xA;&#xA;  a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work&#xA;  based on the Library, uncombined with any other library&#xA;  facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the&#xA;  Sections above.&#xA;&#xA;  b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact&#xA;  that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining&#xA;  where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.&#xA;&#xA;  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or&#xA;  distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this&#xA;  License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link&#xA;  with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically&#xA;  terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who&#xA;  have received copies, or rights, from you under this License&#xA;  will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties&#xA;  remain in full compliance.&#xA;&#xA;  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have&#xA;  not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to&#xA;  modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These&#xA;  actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.&#xA;  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work&#xA;  based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this&#xA;  License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,&#xA;  distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.&#xA;&#xA;  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on&#xA;  the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license&#xA;  from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or&#xA;  modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You&#xA;  may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients&apos;&#xA;  exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible&#xA;  for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.&#xA;&#xA;  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of&#xA;  patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to&#xA;  patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court&#xA;  order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of&#xA;  this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this&#xA;  License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy&#xA;  simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other&#xA;  pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not&#xA;  distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license&#xA;  would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by&#xA;  all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you,&#xA;  then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License&#xA;  would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.&#xA;&#xA;  If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable&#xA;  under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is&#xA;  intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to&#xA;  apply in other circumstances.&#xA;&#xA;  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe&#xA;  any patents or other property right claims or to contest&#xA;  validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose&#xA;  of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution&#xA;  system which is implemented by public license practices. Many&#xA;  people have made generous contributions to the wide range of&#xA;  software distributed through that system in reliance on&#xA;  consistent application of that system; it is up to the&#xA;  author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute&#xA;  software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose&#xA;  that choice.&#xA;&#xA;  This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is&#xA;  believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted&#xA;  in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted&#xA;  interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library&#xA;  under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution&#xA;  limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is&#xA;  permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such&#xA;  case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in&#xA;  the body of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new&#xA;  versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.&#xA;  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present&#xA;  version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or&#xA;  concerns.&#xA;&#xA;  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the&#xA;  Library specifies a version number of this License which applies&#xA;  to it and &quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of&#xA;  following the terms and conditions either of that version or of&#xA;  any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If&#xA;  the Library does not specify a license version number, you may&#xA;  choose any version ever published by the Free Software&#xA;  Foundation.&#xA;&#xA;  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other&#xA;  free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible&#xA;  with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For&#xA;  software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation,&#xA;  write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make&#xA;  exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two&#xA;  goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our&#xA;  free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software&#xA;  generally.&#xA;&#xA;  NO WARRANTY&#xA;&#xA;  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO&#xA;  WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE&#xA;  LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT&#xA;  HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS&#xA;  IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR&#xA;  IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES&#xA;  OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE&#xA;  ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS&#xA;  WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE&#xA;  COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;&#xA;  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO&#xA;  IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY&#xA;  MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE&#xA;  LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,&#xA;  INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR&#xA;  INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS&#xA;  OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY&#xA;  YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH&#xA;  ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN&#xA;  ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;  END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;&#xA;  How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries&#xA;&#xA;  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the&#xA;  greatest possible use to the public, we recommend making it free&#xA;  software that everyone can redistribute and change. You can do&#xA;  so by permitting redistribution under these terms (or,&#xA;  alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public&#xA;  License).&#xA;&#xA;  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the&#xA;  library. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source&#xA;  file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and&#xA;  each file should have at least the &quot;copyright&quot; line&#xA;  and a pointer to where the full notice is found.&#xA;&#xA;  &lt;one line to give the library&apos;s name and a brief idea of&#xA;  what it does.&gt; Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt; &lt;name of&#xA;  author&gt;&#xA;&#xA;  This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or&#xA;  modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;  License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either&#xA;  version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later&#xA;  version.&#xA;&#xA;  This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,&#xA;  but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of&#xA;  MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU&#xA;  Lesser General Public License for more details.&#xA;&#xA;  You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;  License along with this library; if not, write to the Free&#xA;  Software Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston,&#xA;  MA 02111-1307 USA&#xA;&#xA;  Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and&#xA;  paper mail.&#xA;&#xA;  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer)&#xA;  or your school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright&#xA;  disclaimer&quot; for the library, if necessary. Here is a&#xA;  sample; alter the names:&#xA;&#xA;  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the&#xA;  library `Frob&apos; (a library for tweaking knobs) written by&#xA;  James Random Hacker.&#xA;&#xA;  &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1990 Ty Coon, President of&#xA;  Vice&#xA;&#xA;  That&apos;s all there is to it!

          GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;Version 2.1, February 1999&#xA;Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.&#xA;59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA&#xA;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies&#xA;of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.&#xA;[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also&#xA;counts&#xA;as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2,&#xA;hence&#xA;the version number 2.1.]&#xA;Preamble&#xA;The licenses for most software are designed to take away your&#xA;freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General&#xA;Public&#xA;Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and&#xA;change&#xA;free software--to make sure the software is free for all its&#xA;users.&#xA;This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some&#xA;specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of&#xA;the&#xA;Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use&#xA;it.  You&#xA;can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about&#xA;whether&#xA;this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better&#xA;strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations&#xA;below.&#xA;When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of&#xA;use,&#xA;not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make&#xA;sure that&#xA;you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and&#xA;charge&#xA;for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or&#xA;can get&#xA;it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces&#xA;of&#xA;it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can&#xA;do&#xA;these things.&#xA;To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid&#xA;distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender&#xA;these&#xA;rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities&#xA;for&#xA;you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify&#xA;it.&#xA;For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether&#xA;gratis&#xA;or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that&#xA;we gave&#xA;you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the&#xA;source&#xA;code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide&#xA;complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink&#xA;them&#xA;with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling&#xA;it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.&#xA;We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright&#xA;the&#xA;library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal&#xA;permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.&#xA;To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that&#xA;there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library&#xA;is&#xA;modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should&#xA;know&#xA;that what they have is not the original version, so that the&#xA;original&#xA;author&apos;s reputation will not be affected by problems that might&#xA;be&#xA;introduced by others.&#xA;Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence&#xA;of&#xA;any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot&#xA;effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining&#xA;a&#xA;restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist&#xA;that&#xA;any patent license obtained for a version of the library must&#xA;be&#xA;consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.&#xA;Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the&#xA;ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser&#xA;General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries,&#xA;and&#xA;is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.&#xA;We use&#xA;this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking&#xA;those&#xA;libraries into non-free programs.&#xA;When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or&#xA;using&#xA;a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking&#xA;a&#xA;combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary&#xA;General Public License therefore permits such linking only if&#xA;the&#xA;entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser&#xA;General&#xA;Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code&#xA;with&#xA;the library.&#xA;We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because&#xA;it&#xA;does Less to protect the user&apos;s freedom than the ordinary General&#xA;Public License.  It also provides other free software developers&#xA;Less&#xA;of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages&#xA;are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for&#xA;many&#xA;libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in&#xA;certain&#xA;special circumstances.&#xA;For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to&#xA;encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that&#xA;it becomes&#xA;a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must&#xA;be&#xA;allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free&#xA;library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.&#xA;In this&#xA;case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to&#xA;free&#xA;software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.&#xA;In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free&#xA;programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body&#xA;of&#xA;free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library&#xA;in&#xA;non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU&#xA;operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating&#xA;system.&#xA;Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective&#xA;of the&#xA;users&apos; freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that&#xA;is&#xA;linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to&#xA;run&#xA;that program using a modified version of the Library.&#xA;The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between&#xA;a&#xA;&quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;.&#xA;The&#xA;former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter&#xA;must&#xA;be combined with the library in order to run.&#xA;GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION&#xA;0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or&#xA;other&#xA;program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder&#xA;or&#xA;other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the&#xA;terms of&#xA;this Lesser General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;).&#xA;Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.&#xA;A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data&#xA;prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs&#xA;(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.&#xA;The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or&#xA;work&#xA;which has been distributed under these terms.  A &quot;work based&#xA;on the&#xA;Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under&#xA;copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library&#xA;or a&#xA;portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated&#xA;straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation&#xA;is&#xA;included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)&#xA;&quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work&#xA;for&#xA;making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code&#xA;means&#xA;all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated&#xA;interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control&#xA;compilation&#xA;and installation of the library.&#xA;Activities other than copying, distribution and modification&#xA;are not&#xA;covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act&#xA;of&#xA;running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output&#xA;from&#xA;such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work&#xA;based&#xA;on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool&#xA;for&#xA;writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library&#xA;does&#xA;and what the program that uses the Library does.&#xA;1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library&apos;s&#xA;complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided&#xA;that&#xA;you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an&#xA;appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep&#xA;intact&#xA;all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence&#xA;of any&#xA;warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the&#xA;Library.&#xA;You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,&#xA;and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange&#xA;for a&#xA;fee.&#xA;2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion&#xA;of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and&#xA;distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section&#xA;1&#xA;above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;a) The modified work must itself be a software library.&#xA;b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices&#xA;stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.&#xA;c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no&#xA;charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.&#xA;d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function&#xA;or a&#xA;table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses&#xA;the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility&#xA;is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure&#xA;that,&#xA;in the event an application does not supply such function or&#xA;table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part&#xA;of&#xA;its purpose remains meaningful.&#xA;(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots&#xA;has&#xA;a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the&#xA;application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any&#xA;application-supplied function or table used by this function&#xA;must&#xA;be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square&#xA;root function must still compute square roots.)&#xA;These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If&#xA;identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,&#xA;and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works&#xA;in&#xA;themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to&#xA;those&#xA;sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when&#xA;you&#xA;distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work&#xA;based&#xA;on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the&#xA;terms of&#xA;this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to&#xA;the&#xA;entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who&#xA;wrote&#xA;it.&#xA;Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or&#xA;contest&#xA;your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent&#xA;is to&#xA;exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative&#xA;or&#xA;collective works based on the Library.&#xA;In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the&#xA;Library&#xA;with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume&#xA;of&#xA;a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work&#xA;under&#xA;the scope of this License.&#xA;3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General&#xA;Public&#xA;License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.&#xA;To do&#xA;this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License,&#xA;so&#xA;that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version&#xA;2,&#xA;instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version&#xA;2 of the&#xA;ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can&#xA;specify&#xA;that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change&#xA;in&#xA;these notices.&#xA;Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible&#xA;for&#xA;that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies&#xA;to all&#xA;subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.&#xA;This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code&#xA;of&#xA;the Library into a program that is not a library.&#xA;4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or&#xA;derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable&#xA;form&#xA;under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany&#xA;it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code,&#xA;which&#xA;must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above&#xA;on a&#xA;medium customarily used for software interchange.&#xA;If distribution of object code is made by offering access to&#xA;copy&#xA;from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy&#xA;the&#xA;source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to&#xA;distribute the source code, even though third parties are not&#xA;compelled to copy the source along with the object code.&#xA;5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the&#xA;Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled&#xA;or&#xA;linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;.  Such&#xA;a&#xA;work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library,&#xA;and&#xA;therefore falls outside the scope of this License.&#xA;However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library&#xA;creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because&#xA;it&#xA;contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses&#xA;the&#xA;library&quot;.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.&#xA;Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.&#xA;When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header&#xA;file&#xA;that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may&#xA;be a&#xA;derivative work of the Library even though the source code is&#xA;not.&#xA;Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can&#xA;be&#xA;linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.&#xA;The&#xA;threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.&#xA;If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data&#xA;structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline&#xA;functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the&#xA;object&#xA;file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative&#xA;work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions&#xA;of the&#xA;Library will still fall under Section 6.)&#xA;Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may&#xA;distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section&#xA;6.&#xA;Any executables containing that work also fall under Section&#xA;6,&#xA;whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.&#xA;6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine&#xA;or&#xA;link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce&#xA;a&#xA;work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that&#xA;work&#xA;under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit&#xA;modification of the work for the customer&apos;s own use and reverse&#xA;engineering for debugging such modifications.&#xA;You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that&#xA;the&#xA;Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered&#xA;by&#xA;this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the&#xA;work&#xA;during execution displays copyright notices, you must include&#xA;the&#xA;copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference&#xA;directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must&#xA;do one&#xA;of these things:&#xA;a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding&#xA;machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever&#xA;changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under&#xA;Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked&#xA;with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that&#xA;uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that&#xA;the&#xA;user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified&#xA;executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood&#xA;that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in&#xA;the&#xA;Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application&#xA;to use the modified definitions.)&#xA;b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the&#xA;Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time&#xA;a&#xA;copy of the library already present on the user&apos;s computer system,&#xA;rather than copying library functions into the executable, and&#xA;(2)&#xA;will operate properly with a modified version of the library,&#xA;if&#xA;the user installs one, as long as the modified version is&#xA;interface-compatible with the version that the work was made&#xA;with.&#xA;c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at&#xA;least three years, to give the same user the materials&#xA;specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more&#xA;than the cost of performing this distribution.&#xA;d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to&#xA;copy&#xA;from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the&#xA;above&#xA;specified materials from the same place.&#xA;e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these&#xA;materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.&#xA;For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the&#xA;Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for&#xA;reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,&#xA;the materials to be distributed need not include anything that&#xA;is&#xA;normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the&#xA;major&#xA;components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system&#xA;on&#xA;which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies&#xA;the executable.&#xA;It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license&#xA;restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally&#xA;accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you&#xA;cannot&#xA;use both them and the Library together in an executable that&#xA;you&#xA;distribute.&#xA;7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on&#xA;the&#xA;Library side-by-side in a single library together with other&#xA;library&#xA;facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a&#xA;combined&#xA;library, provided that the separate distribution of the work&#xA;based on&#xA;the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise&#xA;permitted, and provided that you do these two things:&#xA;a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work&#xA;based on the Library, uncombined with any other library&#xA;facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the&#xA;Sections above.&#xA;b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact&#xA;that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining&#xA;where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.&#xA;8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute&#xA;the Library except as expressly provided under this License.&#xA;Any&#xA;attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or&#xA;distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate&#xA;your&#xA;rights under this License.  However, parties who have received&#xA;copies,&#xA;or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses&#xA;terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.&#xA;9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have&#xA;not&#xA;signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify&#xA;or&#xA;distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions&#xA;are&#xA;prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore,&#xA;by&#xA;modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the&#xA;Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do&#xA;so, and&#xA;all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying&#xA;the Library or works based on it.&#xA;10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based&#xA;on the&#xA;Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from&#xA;the&#xA;original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the&#xA;Library&#xA;subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any&#xA;further&#xA;restrictions on the recipients&apos; exercise of the rights granted&#xA;herein.&#xA;You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties&#xA;with&#xA;this License.&#xA;11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of&#xA;patent&#xA;infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),&#xA;conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement&#xA;or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they&#xA;do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot&#xA;distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under&#xA;this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence&#xA;you&#xA;may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent&#xA;license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library&#xA;by&#xA;all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you,&#xA;then&#xA;the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would&#xA;be to&#xA;refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.&#xA;If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable&#xA;under any&#xA;particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended&#xA;to apply,&#xA;and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.&#xA;It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe&#xA;any&#xA;patents or other property right claims or to contest validity&#xA;of any&#xA;such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting&#xA;the&#xA;integrity of the free software distribution system which is&#xA;implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made&#xA;generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed&#xA;through that system in reliance on consistent application of&#xA;that&#xA;system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is&#xA;willing&#xA;to distribute software through any other system and a licensee&#xA;cannot&#xA;impose that choice.&#xA;This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed&#xA;to&#xA;be a consequence of the rest of this License.&#xA;12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted&#xA;in&#xA;certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,&#xA;the&#xA;original copyright holder who places the Library under this License&#xA;may add&#xA;an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those&#xA;countries,&#xA;so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries&#xA;not thus&#xA;excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation&#xA;as if&#xA;written in the body of this License.&#xA;13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new&#xA;versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.&#xA;Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,&#xA;but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.&#xA;Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&#xA;Library&#xA;specifies a version number of this License which applies to it&#xA;and&#xA;&quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms&#xA;and&#xA;conditions either of that version or of any later version published&#xA;by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify&#xA;a&#xA;license version number, you may choose any version ever published&#xA;by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation.&#xA;14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other&#xA;free&#xA;programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with&#xA;these,&#xA;write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which&#xA;is&#xA;copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free&#xA;Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. &#xA;Our&#xA;decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free&#xA;status&#xA;of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the&#xA;sharing&#xA;and reuse of software generally.&#xA;NO WARRANTY&#xA;15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS&#xA;NO&#xA;WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE&#xA;LAW.&#xA;EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS&#xA;AND/OR&#xA;OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF&#xA;ANY&#xA;KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED&#xA;TO, THE&#xA;IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#xA;PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF&#xA;THE&#xA;LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU&#xA;ASSUME&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO&#xA;IN&#xA;WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY&#xA;MODIFY&#xA;AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE&#xA;TO YOU&#xA;FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR&#xA;CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO&#xA;USE THE&#xA;LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING&#xA;RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES&#xA;OR A&#xA;FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN&#xA;IF&#xA;SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY&#xA;OF SUCH&#xA;DAMAGES.&#xA;END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries&#xA;If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest&#xA;possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software&#xA;that&#xA;everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting&#xA;redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the&#xA;terms of the&#xA;ordinary General Public License).&#xA;To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.&#xA;It is&#xA;safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most&#xA;effectively&#xA;convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at&#xA;least the&#xA;&quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.&#xA;&lt;one line to give the library&apos;s name and a brief idea of what&#xA;it does.&gt;&#xA;Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;&#xA;This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or&#xA;modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either&#xA;version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.&#xA;This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,&#xA;but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of&#xA;MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the&#xA;GNU&#xA;Lesser General Public License for more details.&#xA;You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software&#xA;Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307&#xA;USA&#xA;Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and&#xA;paper mail.&#xA;You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer)&#xA;or your&#xA;school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the library,&#xA;if&#xA;necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:&#xA;Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the&#xA;library `Frob&apos; (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James&#xA;Random Hacker.&#xA;&lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1990&#xA;Ty Coon, President of Vice&#xA;That&apos;s all there is to it!

        GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;Version 2.1, February 1999&#xA;Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.&#xA;59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA&#xA;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies&#xA;of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.&#xA;[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also&#xA;counts&#xA;as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2,&#xA;hence&#xA;the version number 2.1.]&#xA;Preamble&#xA;The licenses for most software are designed to take away your&#xA;freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General&#xA;Public&#xA;Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and&#xA;change&#xA;free software--to make sure the software is free for all its&#xA;users.&#xA;This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some&#xA;specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of&#xA;the&#xA;Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use&#xA;it.  You&#xA;can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about&#xA;whether&#xA;this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better&#xA;strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations&#xA;below.&#xA;When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of&#xA;use,&#xA;not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make&#xA;sure that&#xA;you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and&#xA;charge&#xA;for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or&#xA;can get&#xA;it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces&#xA;of&#xA;it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can&#xA;do&#xA;these things.&#xA;To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid&#xA;distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender&#xA;these&#xA;rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities&#xA;for&#xA;you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify&#xA;it.&#xA;For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether&#xA;gratis&#xA;or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that&#xA;we gave&#xA;you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the&#xA;source&#xA;code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide&#xA;complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink&#xA;them&#xA;with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling&#xA;it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.&#xA;We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright&#xA;the&#xA;library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal&#xA;permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.&#xA;To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that&#xA;there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library&#xA;is&#xA;modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should&#xA;know&#xA;that what they have is not the original version, so that the&#xA;original&#xA;author&apos;s reputation will not be affected by problems that might&#xA;be&#xA;introduced by others.&#xA;Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence&#xA;of&#xA;any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot&#xA;effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining&#xA;a&#xA;restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist&#xA;that&#xA;any patent license obtained for a version of the library must&#xA;be&#xA;consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.&#xA;Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the&#xA;ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser&#xA;General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries,&#xA;and&#xA;is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.&#xA;We use&#xA;this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking&#xA;those&#xA;libraries into non-free programs.&#xA;When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or&#xA;using&#xA;a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking&#xA;a&#xA;combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary&#xA;General Public License therefore permits such linking only if&#xA;the&#xA;entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser&#xA;General&#xA;Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code&#xA;with&#xA;the library.&#xA;We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because&#xA;it&#xA;does Less to protect the user&apos;s freedom than the ordinary General&#xA;Public License.  It also provides other free software developers&#xA;Less&#xA;of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages&#xA;are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for&#xA;many&#xA;libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in&#xA;certain&#xA;special circumstances.&#xA;For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to&#xA;encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that&#xA;it becomes&#xA;a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must&#xA;be&#xA;allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free&#xA;library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.&#xA;In this&#xA;case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to&#xA;free&#xA;software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.&#xA;In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free&#xA;programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body&#xA;of&#xA;free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library&#xA;in&#xA;non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU&#xA;operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating&#xA;system.&#xA;Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective&#xA;of the&#xA;users&apos; freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that&#xA;is&#xA;linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to&#xA;run&#xA;that program using a modified version of the Library.&#xA;The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between&#xA;a&#xA;&quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;.&#xA;The&#xA;former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter&#xA;must&#xA;be combined with the library in order to run.&#xA;GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION&#xA;0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or&#xA;other&#xA;program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder&#xA;or&#xA;other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the&#xA;terms of&#xA;this Lesser General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;).&#xA;Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.&#xA;A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data&#xA;prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs&#xA;(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.&#xA;The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or&#xA;work&#xA;which has been distributed under these terms.  A &quot;work based&#xA;on the&#xA;Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under&#xA;copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library&#xA;or a&#xA;portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated&#xA;straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation&#xA;is&#xA;included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)&#xA;&quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work&#xA;for&#xA;making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code&#xA;means&#xA;all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated&#xA;interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control&#xA;compilation&#xA;and installation of the library.&#xA;Activities other than copying, distribution and modification&#xA;are not&#xA;covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act&#xA;of&#xA;running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output&#xA;from&#xA;such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work&#xA;based&#xA;on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool&#xA;for&#xA;writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library&#xA;does&#xA;and what the program that uses the Library does.&#xA;1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library&apos;s&#xA;complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided&#xA;that&#xA;you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an&#xA;appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep&#xA;intact&#xA;all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence&#xA;of any&#xA;warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the&#xA;Library.&#xA;You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,&#xA;and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange&#xA;for a&#xA;fee.&#xA;2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion&#xA;of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and&#xA;distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section&#xA;1&#xA;above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;a) The modified work must itself be a software library.&#xA;b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices&#xA;stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.&#xA;c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no&#xA;charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.&#xA;d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function&#xA;or a&#xA;table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses&#xA;the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility&#xA;is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure&#xA;that,&#xA;in the event an application does not supply such function or&#xA;table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part&#xA;of&#xA;its purpose remains meaningful.&#xA;(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots&#xA;has&#xA;a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the&#xA;application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any&#xA;application-supplied function or table used by this function&#xA;must&#xA;be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square&#xA;root function must still compute square roots.)&#xA;These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If&#xA;identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,&#xA;and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works&#xA;in&#xA;themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to&#xA;those&#xA;sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when&#xA;you&#xA;distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work&#xA;based&#xA;on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the&#xA;terms of&#xA;this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to&#xA;the&#xA;entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who&#xA;wrote&#xA;it.&#xA;Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or&#xA;contest&#xA;your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent&#xA;is to&#xA;exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative&#xA;or&#xA;collective works based on the Library.&#xA;In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the&#xA;Library&#xA;with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume&#xA;of&#xA;a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work&#xA;under&#xA;the scope of this License.&#xA;3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General&#xA;Public&#xA;License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.&#xA;To do&#xA;this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License,&#xA;so&#xA;that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version&#xA;2,&#xA;instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version&#xA;2 of the&#xA;ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can&#xA;specify&#xA;that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change&#xA;in&#xA;these notices.&#xA;Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible&#xA;for&#xA;that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies&#xA;to all&#xA;subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.&#xA;This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code&#xA;of&#xA;the Library into a program that is not a library.&#xA;4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or&#xA;derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable&#xA;form&#xA;under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany&#xA;it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code,&#xA;which&#xA;must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above&#xA;on a&#xA;medium customarily used for software interchange.&#xA;If distribution of object code is made by offering access to&#xA;copy&#xA;from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy&#xA;the&#xA;source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to&#xA;distribute the source code, even though third parties are not&#xA;compelled to copy the source along with the object code.&#xA;5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the&#xA;Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled&#xA;or&#xA;linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;.  Such&#xA;a&#xA;work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library,&#xA;and&#xA;therefore falls outside the scope of this License.&#xA;However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library&#xA;creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because&#xA;it&#xA;contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses&#xA;the&#xA;library&quot;.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.&#xA;Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.&#xA;When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header&#xA;file&#xA;that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may&#xA;be a&#xA;derivative work of the Library even though the source code is&#xA;not.&#xA;Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can&#xA;be&#xA;linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.&#xA;The&#xA;threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.&#xA;If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data&#xA;structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline&#xA;functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the&#xA;object&#xA;file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative&#xA;work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions&#xA;of the&#xA;Library will still fall under Section 6.)&#xA;Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may&#xA;distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section&#xA;6.&#xA;Any executables containing that work also fall under Section&#xA;6,&#xA;whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.&#xA;6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine&#xA;or&#xA;link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce&#xA;a&#xA;work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that&#xA;work&#xA;under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit&#xA;modification of the work for the customer&apos;s own use and reverse&#xA;engineering for debugging such modifications.&#xA;You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that&#xA;the&#xA;Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered&#xA;by&#xA;this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the&#xA;work&#xA;during execution displays copyright notices, you must include&#xA;the&#xA;copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference&#xA;directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must&#xA;do one&#xA;of these things:&#xA;a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding&#xA;machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever&#xA;changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under&#xA;Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked&#xA;with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that&#xA;uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that&#xA;the&#xA;user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified&#xA;executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood&#xA;that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in&#xA;the&#xA;Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application&#xA;to use the modified definitions.)&#xA;b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the&#xA;Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time&#xA;a&#xA;copy of the library already present on the user&apos;s computer system,&#xA;rather than copying library functions into the executable, and&#xA;(2)&#xA;will operate properly with a modified version of the library,&#xA;if&#xA;the user installs one, as long as the modified version is&#xA;interface-compatible with the version that the work was made&#xA;with.&#xA;c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at&#xA;least three years, to give the same user the materials&#xA;specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more&#xA;than the cost of performing this distribution.&#xA;d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to&#xA;copy&#xA;from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the&#xA;above&#xA;specified materials from the same place.&#xA;e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these&#xA;materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.&#xA;For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the&#xA;Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for&#xA;reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,&#xA;the materials to be distributed need not include anything that&#xA;is&#xA;normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the&#xA;major&#xA;components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system&#xA;on&#xA;which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies&#xA;the executable.&#xA;It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license&#xA;restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally&#xA;accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you&#xA;cannot&#xA;use both them and the Library together in an executable that&#xA;you&#xA;distribute.&#xA;7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on&#xA;the&#xA;Library side-by-side in a single library together with other&#xA;library&#xA;facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a&#xA;combined&#xA;library, provided that the separate distribution of the work&#xA;based on&#xA;the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise&#xA;permitted, and provided that you do these two things:&#xA;a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work&#xA;based on the Library, uncombined with any other library&#xA;facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the&#xA;Sections above.&#xA;b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact&#xA;that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining&#xA;where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.&#xA;8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute&#xA;the Library except as expressly provided under this License.&#xA;Any&#xA;attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or&#xA;distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate&#xA;your&#xA;rights under this License.  However, parties who have received&#xA;copies,&#xA;or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses&#xA;terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.&#xA;9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have&#xA;not&#xA;signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify&#xA;or&#xA;distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions&#xA;are&#xA;prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore,&#xA;by&#xA;modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the&#xA;Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do&#xA;so, and&#xA;all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying&#xA;the Library or works based on it.&#xA;10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based&#xA;on the&#xA;Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from&#xA;the&#xA;original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the&#xA;Library&#xA;subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any&#xA;further&#xA;restrictions on the recipients&apos; exercise of the rights granted&#xA;herein.&#xA;You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties&#xA;with&#xA;this License.&#xA;11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of&#xA;patent&#xA;infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),&#xA;conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement&#xA;or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they&#xA;do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot&#xA;distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under&#xA;this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence&#xA;you&#xA;may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent&#xA;license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library&#xA;by&#xA;all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you,&#xA;then&#xA;the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would&#xA;be to&#xA;refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.&#xA;If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable&#xA;under any&#xA;particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended&#xA;to apply,&#xA;and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.&#xA;It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe&#xA;any&#xA;patents or other property right claims or to contest validity&#xA;of any&#xA;such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting&#xA;the&#xA;integrity of the free software distribution system which is&#xA;implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made&#xA;generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed&#xA;through that system in reliance on consistent application of&#xA;that&#xA;system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is&#xA;willing&#xA;to distribute software through any other system and a licensee&#xA;cannot&#xA;impose that choice.&#xA;This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed&#xA;to&#xA;be a consequence of the rest of this License.&#xA;12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted&#xA;in&#xA;certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,&#xA;the&#xA;original copyright holder who places the Library under this License&#xA;may add&#xA;an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those&#xA;countries,&#xA;so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries&#xA;not thus&#xA;excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation&#xA;as if&#xA;written in the body of this License.&#xA;13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new&#xA;versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.&#xA;Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,&#xA;but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.&#xA;Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&#xA;Library&#xA;specifies a version number of this License which applies to it&#xA;and&#xA;&quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms&#xA;and&#xA;conditions either of that version or of any later version published&#xA;by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify&#xA;a&#xA;license version number, you may choose any version ever published&#xA;by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation.&#xA;14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other&#xA;free&#xA;programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with&#xA;these,&#xA;write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which&#xA;is&#xA;copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free&#xA;Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. &#xA;Our&#xA;decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free&#xA;status&#xA;of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the&#xA;sharing&#xA;and reuse of software generally.&#xA;NO WARRANTY&#xA;15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS&#xA;NO&#xA;WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE&#xA;LAW.&#xA;EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS&#xA;AND/OR&#xA;OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF&#xA;ANY&#xA;KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED&#xA;TO, THE&#xA;IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#xA;PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF&#xA;THE&#xA;LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU&#xA;ASSUME&#xA;THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO&#xA;IN&#xA;WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY&#xA;MODIFY&#xA;AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE&#xA;TO YOU&#xA;FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR&#xA;CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO&#xA;USE THE&#xA;LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING&#xA;RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES&#xA;OR A&#xA;FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN&#xA;IF&#xA;SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY&#xA;OF SUCH&#xA;DAMAGES.&#xA;END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries&#xA;If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest&#xA;possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software&#xA;that&#xA;everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting&#xA;redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the&#xA;terms of the&#xA;ordinary General Public License).&#xA;To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.&#xA;It is&#xA;safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most&#xA;effectively&#xA;convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at&#xA;least the&#xA;&quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.&#xA;&lt;one line to give the library&apos;s name and a brief idea of what&#xA;it does.&gt;&#xA;Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;&#xA;This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or&#xA;modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either&#xA;version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.&#xA;This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,&#xA;but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of&#xA;MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the&#xA;GNU&#xA;Lesser General Public License for more details.&#xA;You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software&#xA;Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307&#xA;USA&#xA;Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and&#xA;paper mail.&#xA;You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer)&#xA;or your&#xA;school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the library,&#xA;if&#xA;necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:&#xA;Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the&#xA;library `Frob&apos; (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James&#xA;Random Hacker.&#xA;&lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1990&#xA;Ty Coon, President of Vice&#xA;That&apos;s all there is to it!

          GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;         Version 2.1, February 1999&#xA;&#xA; Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.&#xA;     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA&#xA; Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies&#xA; of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.&#xA;&#xA;[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts&#xA; as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence&#xA; the version number 2.1.]&#xA;&#xA;       Preamble&#xA;&#xA;  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your&#xA;freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public&#xA;Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change&#xA;free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.&#xA;&#xA;  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some&#xA;specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the&#xA;Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You&#xA;can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether&#xA;this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better&#xA;strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.&#xA;&#xA;  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,&#xA;not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that&#xA;you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge&#xA;for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get&#xA;it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of&#xA;it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do&#xA;these things.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid&#xA;distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these&#xA;rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for&#xA;you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis&#xA;or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave&#xA;you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source&#xA;code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide&#xA;complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them&#xA;with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling&#xA;it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.&#xA;&#xA;  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the&#xA;library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal&#xA;permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that&#xA;there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is&#xA;modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know&#xA;that what they have is not the original version, so that the original&#xA;author&apos;s reputation will not be affected by problems that might be&#xA;introduced by others.&#xA;&#xA;  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of&#xA;any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot&#xA;effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a&#xA;restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that&#xA;any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be&#xA;consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.&#xA;&#xA;  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the&#xA;ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser&#xA;General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and&#xA;is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use&#xA;this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those&#xA;libraries into non-free programs.&#xA;&#xA;  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using&#xA;a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a&#xA;combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary&#xA;General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the&#xA;entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General&#xA;Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with&#xA;the library.&#xA;&#xA;  We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because it&#xA;does Less to protect the user&apos;s freedom than the ordinary General&#xA;Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less&#xA;of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages&#xA;are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many&#xA;libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain&#xA;special circumstances.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to&#xA;encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes&#xA;a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be&#xA;allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free&#xA;library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this&#xA;case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free&#xA;software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free&#xA;programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of&#xA;free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in&#xA;non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU&#xA;operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating&#xA;system.&#xA;&#xA;  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the&#xA;users&apos; freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is&#xA;linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run&#xA;that program using a modified version of the Library.&#xA;&#xA;  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a&#xA;&quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;.  The&#xA;former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must&#xA;be combined with the library in order to run.&#xA;&#xA;    GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION&#xA;&#xA;  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other&#xA;program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or&#xA;other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of&#xA;this Lesser General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;).&#xA;Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data&#xA;prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs&#xA;(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work&#xA;which has been distributed under these terms.  A &quot;work based on the&#xA;Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under&#xA;copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a&#xA;portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated&#xA;straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is&#xA;included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for&#xA;making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means&#xA;all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated&#xA;interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation&#xA;and installation of the library.&#xA;&#xA;  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not&#xA;covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of&#xA;running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from&#xA;such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based&#xA;on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for&#xA;writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does&#xA;and what the program that uses the Library does.&#xA;  &#xA;  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library&apos;s&#xA;complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that&#xA;you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an&#xA;appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact&#xA;all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any&#xA;warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the&#xA;Library.&#xA;&#xA;  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,&#xA;and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a&#xA;fee.&#xA;&#xA;  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion&#xA;of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and&#xA;distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1&#xA;above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;&#xA;    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.&#xA;&#xA;    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices&#xA;    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.&#xA;&#xA;    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no&#xA;    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.&#xA;&#xA;    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a&#xA;    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses&#xA;    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility&#xA;    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,&#xA;    in the event an application does not supply such function or&#xA;    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of&#xA;    its purpose remains meaningful.&#xA;&#xA;    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has&#xA;    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the&#xA;    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any&#xA;    application-supplied function or table used by this function must&#xA;    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square&#xA;    root function must still compute square roots.)&#xA;&#xA;These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If&#xA;identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,&#xA;and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in&#xA;themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those&#xA;sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you&#xA;distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based&#xA;on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of&#xA;this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the&#xA;entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote&#xA;it.&#xA;&#xA;Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest&#xA;your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to&#xA;exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or&#xA;collective works based on the Library.&#xA;&#xA;In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library&#xA;with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of&#xA;a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under&#xA;the scope of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public&#xA;License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do&#xA;this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so&#xA;that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,&#xA;instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the&#xA;ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify&#xA;that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in&#xA;these notices.&#xA;&#xA;  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for&#xA;that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all&#xA;subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.&#xA;&#xA;  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of&#xA;the Library into a program that is not a library.&#xA;&#xA;  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or&#xA;derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form&#xA;under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany&#xA;it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which&#xA;must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a&#xA;medium customarily used for software interchange.&#xA;&#xA;  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy&#xA;from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the&#xA;source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to&#xA;distribute the source code, even though third parties are not&#xA;compelled to copy the source along with the object code.&#xA;&#xA;  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the&#xA;Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or&#xA;linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;.  Such a&#xA;work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and&#xA;therefore falls outside the scope of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library&#xA;creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it&#xA;contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses the&#xA;library&quot;.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.&#xA;Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.&#xA;&#xA;  When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header file&#xA;that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a&#xA;derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.&#xA;Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be&#xA;linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The&#xA;threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.&#xA;&#xA;  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data&#xA;structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline&#xA;functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object&#xA;file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative&#xA;work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the&#xA;Library will still fall under Section 6.)&#xA;&#xA;  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may&#xA;distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.&#xA;Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,&#xA;whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.&#xA;&#xA;  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or&#xA;link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce a&#xA;work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work&#xA;under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit&#xA;modification of the work for the customer&apos;s own use and reverse&#xA;engineering for debugging such modifications.&#xA;&#xA;  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the&#xA;Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by&#xA;this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work&#xA;during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the&#xA;copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference&#xA;directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one&#xA;of these things:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding&#xA;    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever&#xA;    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under&#xA;    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked&#xA;    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that&#xA;    uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that the&#xA;    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified&#xA;    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood&#xA;    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the&#xA;    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application&#xA;    to use the modified definitions.)&#xA;&#xA;    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the&#xA;    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a&#xA;    copy of the library already present on the user&apos;s computer system,&#xA;    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)&#xA;    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if&#xA;    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is&#xA;    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.&#xA;&#xA;    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at&#xA;    least three years, to give the same user the materials&#xA;    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more&#xA;    than the cost of performing this distribution.&#xA;&#xA;    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy&#xA;    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above&#xA;    specified materials from the same place.&#xA;&#xA;    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these&#xA;    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.&#xA;&#xA;  For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the&#xA;Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for&#xA;reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,&#xA;the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is&#xA;normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major&#xA;components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on&#xA;which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies&#xA;the executable.&#xA;&#xA;  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license&#xA;restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally&#xA;accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot&#xA;use both them and the Library together in an executable that you&#xA;distribute.&#xA;&#xA;  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the&#xA;Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library&#xA;facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined&#xA;library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on&#xA;the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise&#xA;permitted, and provided that you do these two things:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work&#xA;    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library&#xA;    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the&#xA;    Sections above.&#xA;&#xA;    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact&#xA;    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining&#xA;    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.&#xA;&#xA;  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute&#xA;the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any&#xA;attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or&#xA;distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your&#xA;rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,&#xA;or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses&#xA;terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.&#xA;&#xA;  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not&#xA;signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or&#xA;distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are&#xA;prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by&#xA;modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the&#xA;Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and&#xA;all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying&#xA;the Library or works based on it.&#xA;&#xA;  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the&#xA;Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the&#xA;original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library&#xA;subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further&#xA;restrictions on the recipients&apos; exercise of the rights granted herein.&#xA;You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with&#xA;this License.&#xA;&#xA;  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent&#xA;infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),&#xA;conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot&#xA;distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you&#xA;may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent&#xA;license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by&#xA;all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then&#xA;the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to&#xA;refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.&#xA;&#xA;If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any&#xA;particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,&#xA;and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.&#xA;&#xA;It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any&#xA;patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any&#xA;such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the&#xA;integrity of the free software distribution system which is&#xA;implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made&#xA;generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed&#xA;through that system in reliance on consistent application of that&#xA;system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing&#xA;to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot&#xA;impose that choice.&#xA;&#xA;This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to&#xA;be a consequence of the rest of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in&#xA;certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the&#xA;original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add&#xA;an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,&#xA;so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus&#xA;excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if&#xA;written in the body of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new&#xA;versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.&#xA;Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,&#xA;but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.&#xA;&#xA;Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library&#xA;specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and&#xA;&quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and&#xA;conditions either of that version or of any later version published by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a&#xA;license version number, you may choose any version ever published by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation.&#xA;&#xA;  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free&#xA;programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,&#xA;write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is&#xA;copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free&#xA;Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our&#xA;decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status&#xA;of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing&#xA;and reuse of software generally.&#xA;&#xA;       NO WARRANTY&#xA;&#xA;  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO&#xA;WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.&#xA;EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR&#xA;OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY&#xA;KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE&#xA;IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#xA;PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE&#xA;LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME&#xA;THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;&#xA;  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN&#xA;WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY&#xA;AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU&#xA;FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR&#xA;CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE&#xA;LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING&#xA;RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A&#xA;FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF&#xA;SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH&#xA;DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;       END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;&#xA;           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries&#xA;&#xA;  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest&#xA;possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that&#xA;everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting&#xA;redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the&#xA;ordinary General Public License).&#xA;&#xA;  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is&#xA;safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively&#xA;convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the&#xA;&quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.&#xA;&#xA;    &lt;one line to give the library&apos;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;&#xA;    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;&#xA;&#xA;    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or&#xA;    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either&#xA;    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.&#xA;&#xA;    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,&#xA;    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of&#xA;    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU&#xA;    Lesser General Public License for more details.&#xA;&#xA;    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software&#xA;    Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA&#xA;&#xA;Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.&#xA;&#xA;You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your&#xA;school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the library, if&#xA;necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:&#xA;&#xA;  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the&#xA;  library `Frob&apos; (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.&#xA;&#xA;  &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1990&#xA;  Ty Coon, President of Vice&#xA;&#xA;That&apos;s all there is to it!

          GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;Version 2.1, February 1999&#xA;Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.&#xA;59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA&#xA;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies&#xA;of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.&#xA;[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also&#xA;counts&#xA;as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2,&#xA;hence&#xA;the version number 2.1.]&#xA;Preamble&#xA;The licenses for most software are designed to take away your&#xA;freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General&#xA;Public&#xA;Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and&#xA;change&#xA;free software--to make sure the software is free for all its&#xA;users.&#xA;This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some&#xA;specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of&#xA;the&#xA;Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use&#xA;it.  You&#xA;can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about&#xA;whether&#xA;this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better&#xA;strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations&#xA;below.&#xA;When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of&#xA;use,&#xA;not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make&#xA;sure that&#xA;you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and&#xA;charge&#xA;for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or&#xA;can get&#xA;it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces&#xA;of&#xA;it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can&#xA;do&#xA;these things.&#xA;To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid&#xA;distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender&#xA;these&#xA;rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities&#xA;for&#xA;you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify&#xA;it.&#xA;For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether&#xA;gratis&#xA;or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that&#xA;we gave&#xA;you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the&#xA;source&#xA;code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide&#xA;complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink&#xA;them&#xA;with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling&#xA;it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.&#xA;We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright&#xA;the&#xA;library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal&#xA;permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.&#xA;To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that&#xA;there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library&#xA;is&#xA;modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should&#xA;know&#xA;that what they have is not the original version, so that the&#xA;original&#xA;author&apos;s reputation will not be affected by problems that might&#xA;be&#xA;introduced by others.&#xA;Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence&#xA;of&#xA;any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot&#xA;effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining&#xA;a&#xA;restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist&#xA;that&#xA;any patent license obtained for a version of the library must&#xA;be&#xA;consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.&#xA;Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the&#xA;ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser&#xA;General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries,&#xA;and&#xA;is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.&#xA;We use&#xA;this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking&#xA;those&#xA;libraries into non-free programs.&#xA;When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or&#xA;using&#xA;a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking&#xA;a&#xA;combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary&#xA;General Public License therefore permits such linking only if&#xA;the&#xA;entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser&#xA;General&#xA;Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code&#xA;with&#xA;the library.&#xA;We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because&#xA;it&#xA;does Less to protect the user&apos;s freedom than the ordinary General&#xA;Public License.  It also provides other free software developers&#xA;Less&#xA;of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages&#xA;are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for&#xA;many&#xA;libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in&#xA;certain&#xA;special circumstances.&#xA;For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to&#xA;encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that&#xA;it becomes&#xA;a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must&#xA;be&#xA;allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free&#xA;library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.&#xA;In this&#xA;case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to&#xA;free&#xA;software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.&#xA;In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free&#xA;programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body&#xA;of&#xA;free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library&#xA;in&#xA;non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU&#xA;operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating&#xA;system.&#xA;Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective&#xA;of the&#xA;users&apos; freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that&#xA;is&#xA;linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to&#xA;run&#xA;that program using a modified version of the Library.&#xA;The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between&#xA;a&#xA;&quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;.&#xA;The&#xA;former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter&#xA;must&#xA;be combined with the library in order to run.&#xA;GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION&#xA;0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or&#xA;other&#xA;program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder&#xA;or&#xA;other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the&#xA;terms of&#xA;this Lesser General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;).&#xA;Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.&#xA;A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data&#xA;prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs&#xA;(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.&#xA;The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or&#xA;work&#xA;which has been distributed under these terms.  A &quot;work based&#xA;on the&#xA;Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under&#xA;copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library&#xA;or a&#xA;portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated&#xA;straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation&#xA;is&#xA;included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)&#xA;&quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work&#xA;for&#xA;making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code&#xA;means&#xA;all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated&#xA;interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control&#xA;compilation&#xA;and installation of the library.&#xA;Activities other than copying, distribution and modification&#xA;are not&#xA;covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act&#xA;of&#xA;running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output&#xA;from&#xA;such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work&#xA;based&#xA;on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool&#xA;for&#xA;writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library&#xA;does&#xA;and what the program that uses the Library does.&#xA;1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library&apos;s&#xA;complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided&#xA;that&#xA;you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an&#xA;appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep&#xA;intact&#xA;all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence&#xA;of any&#xA;warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the&#xA;Library.&#xA;You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,&#xA;and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange&#xA;for a&#xA;fee.&#xA;2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion&#xA;of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and&#xA;distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section&#xA;1&#xA;above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;a) The modified work must itself be a software library.&#xA;b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices&#xA;stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.&#xA;c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no&#xA;charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.&#xA;d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function&#xA;or a&#xA;table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses&#xA;the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility&#xA;is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure&#xA;that,&#xA;in the event an application does not supply such function or&#xA;table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part&#xA;of&#xA;its purpose remains meaningful.&#xA;(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots&#xA;has&#xA;a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the&#xA;application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any&#xA;application-supplied function or table used by this function&#xA;must&#xA;be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square&#xA;root function must still compute square roots.)&#xA;These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If&#xA;identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,&#xA;and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works&#xA;in&#xA;themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to&#xA;those&#xA;sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when&#xA;you&#xA;distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work&#xA;based&#xA;on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the&#xA;terms of&#xA;this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to&#xA;the&#xA;entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who&#xA;wrote&#xA;it.&#xA;Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or&#xA;contest&#xA;your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent&#xA;is to&#xA;exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative&#xA;or&#xA;collective works based on the Library.&#xA;In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the&#xA;Library&#xA;with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume&#xA;of&#xA;a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work&#xA;under&#xA;the scope of this License.&#xA;3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General&#xA;Public&#xA;License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.&#xA;To do&#xA;this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License,&#xA;so&#xA;that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version&#xA;2,&#xA;instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version&#xA;2 of the&#xA;ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can&#xA;specify&#xA;that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change&#xA;in&#xA;these notices.&#xA;Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible&#xA;for&#xA;that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies&#xA;to all&#xA;subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.&#xA;This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code&#xA;of&#xA;the Library into a program that is not a library.&#xA;4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or&#xA;derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable&#xA;form&#xA;under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany&#xA;it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code,&#xA;which&#xA;must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above&#xA;on a&#xA;medium customarily used for software interchange.&#xA;If distribution of object code is made by offering access to&#xA;copy&#xA;from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy&#xA;the&#xA;source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to&#xA;distribute the source code, even though third parties are not&#xA;compelled to copy the source along with the object code.&#xA;5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the&#xA;Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled&#xA;or&#xA;linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;.  Such&#xA;a&#xA;work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library,&#xA;and&#xA;therefore falls outside the scope of this License.&#xA;However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library&#xA;creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because&#xA;it&#xA;contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses&#xA;the&#xA;library&quot;.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.&#xA;Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.&#xA;When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header&#xA;file&#xA;that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may&#xA;be a&#xA;derivative work of the Library even though the source code is&#xA;not.&#xA;Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can&#xA;be&#xA;linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.&#xA;The&#xA;threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.&#xA;If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data&#xA;structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline&#xA;functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the&#xA;object&#xA;file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative&#xA;work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions&#xA;of the&#xA;Library will still fall under Section 6.)&#xA;Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may&#xA;distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section&#xA;6.&#xA;Any executables containing that work also fall under Section&#xA;6,&#xA;whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.&#xA;6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine&#xA;or&#xA;link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce&#xA;a&#xA;work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that&#xA;work&#xA;under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit&#xA;modification of the work for the customer&apos;s own use and reverse&#xA;engineering for debugging such modifications.&#xA;You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that&#xA;the&#xA;Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered&#xA;by&#xA;this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the&#xA;work&#xA;during execution displays copyright notices, you must include&#xA;the&#xA;copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference&#xA;directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must&#xA;do one&#xA;of these things:&#xA;a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding&#xA;machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever&#xA;changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under&#xA;Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked&#xA;with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that&#xA;uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that&#xA;the&#xA;user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified&#xA;executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood&#xA;that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in&#xA;the&#xA;Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application&#xA;to use the modified definitions.)&#xA;b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the&#xA;Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time&#xA;a&#xA;copy of the library already present on the user&apos;s computer system,&#xA;rather than copying library functions into the executable, and&#xA;(2)&#xA;will operate properly with a modified version of the library,&#xA;if&#xA;the user installs one, as long as the modified version is&#xA;interface-compatible with the version that the work was made&#xA;with.&#xA;c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at&#xA;least three years, to give the same user the materials&#xA;specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more&#xA;than the cost of performing this distribution.&#xA;d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to&#xA;copy&#xA;from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the&#xA;above&#xA;specified materials from the same place.&#xA;e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these&#xA;materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.&#xA;For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the&#xA;Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for&#xA;reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,&#xA;the materials to be distributed need not include anything that&#xA;is&#xA;normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the&#xA;major&#xA;components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system&#xA;on&#xA;which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies&#xA;the executable.&#xA;It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license&#xA;restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally&#xA;accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you&#xA;cannot&#xA;use both them and the Library together in an executable that&#xA;you&#xA;distribute.&#xA;7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on&#xA;the&#xA;Library side-by-side in a single library together with other&#xA;library&#xA;facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a&#xA;combined&#xA;library, provided that the separate distribution of the work&#xA;based on&#xA;the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise&#xA;permitted, and provided that you do these two things:&#xA;a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work&#xA;based on the Library, uncombined with any other library&#xA;facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the&#xA;Sections above.&#xA;b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact&#xA;that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining&#xA;where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.&#xA;8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute&#xA;the Library except as expressly provided under this License.&#xA;Any&#xA;attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or&#xA;distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate&#xA;your&#xA;rights under this License.  However, parties who have received&#xA;copies,&#xA;or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses&#xA;terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.&#xA;9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have&#xA;not&#xA;signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify&#xA;or&#xA;distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions&#xA;are&#xA;prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore,&#xA;by&#xA;modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the&#xA;Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do&#xA;so, and&#xA;all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying&#xA;the Library or works based on it.&#xA;10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based&#xA;on the&#xA;Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from&#xA;the&#xA;original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the&#xA;Library&#xA;subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any&#xA;further&#xA;restrictions on the recipients&apos; exercise of the rights granted&#xA;herein.&#xA;You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties&#xA;with&#xA;this License.&#xA;11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of&#xA;patent&#xA;infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),&#xA;conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement&#xA;or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they&#xA;do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot&#xA;distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under&#xA;this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence&#xA;you&#xA;may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent&#xA;license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library&#xA;by&#xA;all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you,&#xA;then&#xA;the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would&#xA;be to&#xA;refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.&#xA;If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable&#xA;under any&#xA;particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended&#xA;to apply,&#xA;and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.&#xA;It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe&#xA;any&#xA;patents or other property right claims or to contest validity&#xA;of any&#xA;such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting&#xA;the&#xA;integrity of the free software distribution system which is&#xA;implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made&#xA;generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed&#xA;through that system in reliance on consistent application of&#xA;that&#xA;system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is&#xA;willing&#xA;to distribute software through any other system and a licensee&#xA;cannot&#xA;impose that choice.&#xA;This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed&#xA;to&#xA;be a consequence of the rest of this License.&#xA;12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted&#xA;in&#xA;certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,&#xA;the&#xA;original copyright holder who places the Library under this License&#xA;may add&#xA;an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those&#xA;countries,&#xA;so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries&#xA;not thus&#xA;excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation&#xA;as if&#xA;written in the body of this License.&#xA;13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new&#xA;versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.&#xA;Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,&#xA;but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.&#xA;Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&#xA;Library&#xA;specifies a version number of this License which applies to it&#xA;and&#xA;&quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms&#xA;and&#xA;conditions either of that version or of any later version published&#xA;by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify&#xA;a&#xA;license version number, you may choose any version ever published&#xA;by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation.&#xA;14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other&#xA;free&#xA;programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with&#xA;these,&#xA;write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which&#xA;is&#xA;copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free&#xA;Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. &#xA;Our&#xA;decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free&#xA;status&#xA;of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the&#xA;sharing&#xA;and reuse of software generally.&#xA;NO WARRANTY&#xA;15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS&#xA;NO&#xA;WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE&#xA;LAW.&#xA;EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS&#xA;AND/OR&#xA;OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF&#xA;ANY&#xA;KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED&#xA;TO, THE&#xA;IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#xA;PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF&#xA;THE&#xA;LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU&#xA;ASSUME&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO&#xA;IN&#xA;WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY&#xA;MODIFY&#xA;AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE&#xA;TO YOU&#xA;FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR&#xA;CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO&#xA;USE THE&#xA;LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING&#xA;RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES&#xA;OR A&#xA;FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN&#xA;IF&#xA;SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY&#xA;OF SUCH&#xA;DAMAGES.&#xA;END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries&#xA;If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest&#xA;possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software&#xA;that&#xA;everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting&#xA;redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the&#xA;terms of the&#xA;ordinary General Public License).&#xA;To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.&#xA;It is&#xA;safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most&#xA;effectively&#xA;convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at&#xA;least the&#xA;&quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.&#xA;&lt;one line to give the library&apos;s name and a brief idea of what&#xA;it does.&gt;&#xA;Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;&#xA;This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or&#xA;modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either&#xA;version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.&#xA;This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,&#xA;but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of&#xA;MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the&#xA;GNU&#xA;Lesser General Public License for more details.&#xA;You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software&#xA;Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307&#xA;USA&#xA;Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and&#xA;paper mail.&#xA;You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer)&#xA;or your&#xA;school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the library,&#xA;if&#xA;necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:&#xA;Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the&#xA;library `Frob&apos; (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James&#xA;Random Hacker.&#xA;&lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1990&#xA;Ty Coon, President of Vice&#xA;That&apos;s all there is to it!

        GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;Version 2.1, February 1999&#xA;Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.&#xA;59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA&#xA;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies&#xA;of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.&#xA;[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also&#xA;counts&#xA;as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2,&#xA;hence&#xA;the version number 2.1.]&#xA;Preamble&#xA;The licenses for most software are designed to take away your&#xA;freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General&#xA;Public&#xA;Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and&#xA;change&#xA;free software--to make sure the software is free for all its&#xA;users.&#xA;This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some&#xA;specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of&#xA;the&#xA;Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use&#xA;it.  You&#xA;can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about&#xA;whether&#xA;this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better&#xA;strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations&#xA;below.&#xA;When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of&#xA;use,&#xA;not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make&#xA;sure that&#xA;you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and&#xA;charge&#xA;for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or&#xA;can get&#xA;it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces&#xA;of&#xA;it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can&#xA;do&#xA;these things.&#xA;To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid&#xA;distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender&#xA;these&#xA;rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities&#xA;for&#xA;you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify&#xA;it.&#xA;For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether&#xA;gratis&#xA;or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that&#xA;we gave&#xA;you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the&#xA;source&#xA;code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide&#xA;complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink&#xA;them&#xA;with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling&#xA;it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.&#xA;We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright&#xA;the&#xA;library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal&#xA;permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.&#xA;To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that&#xA;there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library&#xA;is&#xA;modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should&#xA;know&#xA;that what they have is not the original version, so that the&#xA;original&#xA;author&apos;s reputation will not be affected by problems that might&#xA;be&#xA;introduced by others.&#xA;Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence&#xA;of&#xA;any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot&#xA;effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining&#xA;a&#xA;restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist&#xA;that&#xA;any patent license obtained for a version of the library must&#xA;be&#xA;consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.&#xA;Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the&#xA;ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser&#xA;General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries,&#xA;and&#xA;is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.&#xA;We use&#xA;this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking&#xA;those&#xA;libraries into non-free programs.&#xA;When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or&#xA;using&#xA;a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking&#xA;a&#xA;combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary&#xA;General Public License therefore permits such linking only if&#xA;the&#xA;entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser&#xA;General&#xA;Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code&#xA;with&#xA;the library.&#xA;We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because&#xA;it&#xA;does Less to protect the user&apos;s freedom than the ordinary General&#xA;Public License.  It also provides other free software developers&#xA;Less&#xA;of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages&#xA;are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for&#xA;many&#xA;libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in&#xA;certain&#xA;special circumstances.&#xA;For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to&#xA;encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that&#xA;it becomes&#xA;a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must&#xA;be&#xA;allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free&#xA;library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.&#xA;In this&#xA;case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to&#xA;free&#xA;software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.&#xA;In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free&#xA;programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body&#xA;of&#xA;free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library&#xA;in&#xA;non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU&#xA;operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating&#xA;system.&#xA;Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective&#xA;of the&#xA;users&apos; freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that&#xA;is&#xA;linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to&#xA;run&#xA;that program using a modified version of the Library.&#xA;The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between&#xA;a&#xA;&quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;.&#xA;The&#xA;former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter&#xA;must&#xA;be combined with the library in order to run.&#xA;GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION&#xA;0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or&#xA;other&#xA;program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder&#xA;or&#xA;other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the&#xA;terms of&#xA;this Lesser General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;).&#xA;Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.&#xA;A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data&#xA;prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs&#xA;(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.&#xA;The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or&#xA;work&#xA;which has been distributed under these terms.  A &quot;work based&#xA;on the&#xA;Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under&#xA;copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library&#xA;or a&#xA;portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated&#xA;straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation&#xA;is&#xA;included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)&#xA;&quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work&#xA;for&#xA;making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code&#xA;means&#xA;all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated&#xA;interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control&#xA;compilation&#xA;and installation of the library.&#xA;Activities other than copying, distribution and modification&#xA;are not&#xA;covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act&#xA;of&#xA;running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output&#xA;from&#xA;such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work&#xA;based&#xA;on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool&#xA;for&#xA;writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library&#xA;does&#xA;and what the program that uses the Library does.&#xA;1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library&apos;s&#xA;complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided&#xA;that&#xA;you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an&#xA;appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep&#xA;intact&#xA;all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence&#xA;of any&#xA;warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the&#xA;Library.&#xA;You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,&#xA;and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange&#xA;for a&#xA;fee.&#xA;2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion&#xA;of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and&#xA;distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section&#xA;1&#xA;above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;a) The modified work must itself be a software library.&#xA;b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices&#xA;stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.&#xA;c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no&#xA;charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.&#xA;d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function&#xA;or a&#xA;table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses&#xA;the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility&#xA;is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure&#xA;that,&#xA;in the event an application does not supply such function or&#xA;table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part&#xA;of&#xA;its purpose remains meaningful.&#xA;(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots&#xA;has&#xA;a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the&#xA;application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any&#xA;application-supplied function or table used by this function&#xA;must&#xA;be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square&#xA;root function must still compute square roots.)&#xA;These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If&#xA;identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,&#xA;and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works&#xA;in&#xA;themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to&#xA;those&#xA;sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when&#xA;you&#xA;distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work&#xA;based&#xA;on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the&#xA;terms of&#xA;this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to&#xA;the&#xA;entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who&#xA;wrote&#xA;it.&#xA;Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or&#xA;contest&#xA;your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent&#xA;is to&#xA;exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative&#xA;or&#xA;collective works based on the Library.&#xA;In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the&#xA;Library&#xA;with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume&#xA;of&#xA;a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work&#xA;under&#xA;the scope of this License.&#xA;3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General&#xA;Public&#xA;License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.&#xA;To do&#xA;this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License,&#xA;so&#xA;that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version&#xA;2,&#xA;instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version&#xA;2 of the&#xA;ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can&#xA;specify&#xA;that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change&#xA;in&#xA;these notices.&#xA;Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible&#xA;for&#xA;that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies&#xA;to all&#xA;subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.&#xA;This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code&#xA;of&#xA;the Library into a program that is not a library.&#xA;4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or&#xA;derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable&#xA;form&#xA;under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany&#xA;it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code,&#xA;which&#xA;must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above&#xA;on a&#xA;medium customarily used for software interchange.&#xA;If distribution of object code is made by offering access to&#xA;copy&#xA;from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy&#xA;the&#xA;source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to&#xA;distribute the source code, even though third parties are not&#xA;compelled to copy the source along with the object code.&#xA;5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the&#xA;Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled&#xA;or&#xA;linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;.  Such&#xA;a&#xA;work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library,&#xA;and&#xA;therefore falls outside the scope of this License.&#xA;However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library&#xA;creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because&#xA;it&#xA;contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses&#xA;the&#xA;library&quot;.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.&#xA;Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.&#xA;When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header&#xA;file&#xA;that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may&#xA;be a&#xA;derivative work of the Library even though the source code is&#xA;not.&#xA;Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can&#xA;be&#xA;linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.&#xA;The&#xA;threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.&#xA;If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data&#xA;structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline&#xA;functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the&#xA;object&#xA;file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative&#xA;work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions&#xA;of the&#xA;Library will still fall under Section 6.)&#xA;Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may&#xA;distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section&#xA;6.&#xA;Any executables containing that work also fall under Section&#xA;6,&#xA;whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.&#xA;6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine&#xA;or&#xA;link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce&#xA;a&#xA;work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that&#xA;work&#xA;under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit&#xA;modification of the work for the customer&apos;s own use and reverse&#xA;engineering for debugging such modifications.&#xA;You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that&#xA;the&#xA;Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered&#xA;by&#xA;this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the&#xA;work&#xA;during execution displays copyright notices, you must include&#xA;the&#xA;copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference&#xA;directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must&#xA;do one&#xA;of these things:&#xA;a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding&#xA;machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever&#xA;changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under&#xA;Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked&#xA;with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that&#xA;uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that&#xA;the&#xA;user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified&#xA;executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood&#xA;that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in&#xA;the&#xA;Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application&#xA;to use the modified definitions.)&#xA;b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the&#xA;Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time&#xA;a&#xA;copy of the library already present on the user&apos;s computer system,&#xA;rather than copying library functions into the executable, and&#xA;(2)&#xA;will operate properly with a modified version of the library,&#xA;if&#xA;the user installs one, as long as the modified version is&#xA;interface-compatible with the version that the work was made&#xA;with.&#xA;c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at&#xA;least three years, to give the same user the materials&#xA;specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more&#xA;than the cost of performing this distribution.&#xA;d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to&#xA;copy&#xA;from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the&#xA;above&#xA;specified materials from the same place.&#xA;e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these&#xA;materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.&#xA;For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the&#xA;Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for&#xA;reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,&#xA;the materials to be distributed need not include anything that&#xA;is&#xA;normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the&#xA;major&#xA;components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system&#xA;on&#xA;which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies&#xA;the executable.&#xA;It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license&#xA;restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally&#xA;accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you&#xA;cannot&#xA;use both them and the Library together in an executable that&#xA;you&#xA;distribute.&#xA;7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on&#xA;the&#xA;Library side-by-side in a single library together with other&#xA;library&#xA;facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a&#xA;combined&#xA;library, provided that the separate distribution of the work&#xA;based on&#xA;the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise&#xA;permitted, and provided that you do these two things:&#xA;a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work&#xA;based on the Library, uncombined with any other library&#xA;facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the&#xA;Sections above.&#xA;b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact&#xA;that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining&#xA;where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.&#xA;8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute&#xA;the Library except as expressly provided under this License.&#xA;Any&#xA;attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or&#xA;distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate&#xA;your&#xA;rights under this License.  However, parties who have received&#xA;copies,&#xA;or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses&#xA;terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.&#xA;9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have&#xA;not&#xA;signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify&#xA;or&#xA;distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions&#xA;are&#xA;prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore,&#xA;by&#xA;modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the&#xA;Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do&#xA;so, and&#xA;all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying&#xA;the Library or works based on it.&#xA;10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based&#xA;on the&#xA;Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from&#xA;the&#xA;original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the&#xA;Library&#xA;subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any&#xA;further&#xA;restrictions on the recipients&apos; exercise of the rights granted&#xA;herein.&#xA;You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties&#xA;with&#xA;this License.&#xA;11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of&#xA;patent&#xA;infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),&#xA;conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement&#xA;or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they&#xA;do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot&#xA;distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under&#xA;this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence&#xA;you&#xA;may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent&#xA;license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library&#xA;by&#xA;all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you,&#xA;then&#xA;the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would&#xA;be to&#xA;refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.&#xA;If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable&#xA;under any&#xA;particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended&#xA;to apply,&#xA;and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.&#xA;It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe&#xA;any&#xA;patents or other property right claims or to contest validity&#xA;of any&#xA;such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting&#xA;the&#xA;integrity of the free software distribution system which is&#xA;implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made&#xA;generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed&#xA;through that system in reliance on consistent application of&#xA;that&#xA;system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is&#xA;willing&#xA;to distribute software through any other system and a licensee&#xA;cannot&#xA;impose that choice.&#xA;This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed&#xA;to&#xA;be a consequence of the rest of this License.&#xA;12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted&#xA;in&#xA;certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,&#xA;the&#xA;original copyright holder who places the Library under this License&#xA;may add&#xA;an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those&#xA;countries,&#xA;so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries&#xA;not thus&#xA;excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation&#xA;as if&#xA;written in the body of this License.&#xA;13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new&#xA;versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.&#xA;Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,&#xA;but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.&#xA;Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&#xA;Library&#xA;specifies a version number of this License which applies to it&#xA;and&#xA;&quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms&#xA;and&#xA;conditions either of that version or of any later version published&#xA;by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify&#xA;a&#xA;license version number, you may choose any version ever published&#xA;by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation.&#xA;14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other&#xA;free&#xA;programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with&#xA;these,&#xA;write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which&#xA;is&#xA;copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free&#xA;Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. &#xA;Our&#xA;decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free&#xA;status&#xA;of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the&#xA;sharing&#xA;and reuse of software generally.&#xA;NO WARRANTY&#xA;15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS&#xA;NO&#xA;WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE&#xA;LAW.&#xA;EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS&#xA;AND/OR&#xA;OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF&#xA;ANY&#xA;KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED&#xA;TO, THE&#xA;IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#xA;PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF&#xA;THE&#xA;LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU&#xA;ASSUME&#xA;THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO&#xA;IN&#xA;WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY&#xA;MODIFY&#xA;AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE&#xA;TO YOU&#xA;FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR&#xA;CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO&#xA;USE THE&#xA;LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING&#xA;RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES&#xA;OR A&#xA;FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN&#xA;IF&#xA;SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY&#xA;OF SUCH&#xA;DAMAGES.&#xA;END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries&#xA;If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest&#xA;possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software&#xA;that&#xA;everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting&#xA;redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the&#xA;terms of the&#xA;ordinary General Public License).&#xA;To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.&#xA;It is&#xA;safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most&#xA;effectively&#xA;convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at&#xA;least the&#xA;&quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.&#xA;&lt;one line to give the library&apos;s name and a brief idea of what&#xA;it does.&gt;&#xA;Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;&#xA;This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or&#xA;modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either&#xA;version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.&#xA;This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,&#xA;but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of&#xA;MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the&#xA;GNU&#xA;Lesser General Public License for more details.&#xA;You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software&#xA;Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307&#xA;USA&#xA;Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and&#xA;paper mail.&#xA;You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer)&#xA;or your&#xA;school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the library,&#xA;if&#xA;necessary.

          GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;         Version 2.1, February 1999&#xA;&#xA; Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.&#xA;     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA&#xA; Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies&#xA; of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.&#xA;&#xA;[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts&#xA; as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence&#xA; the version number 2.1.]&#xA;&#xA;       Preamble&#xA;&#xA;  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your&#xA;freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public&#xA;Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change&#xA;free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.&#xA;&#xA;  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some&#xA;specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the&#xA;Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You&#xA;can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether&#xA;this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better&#xA;strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.&#xA;&#xA;  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,&#xA;not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that&#xA;you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge&#xA;for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get&#xA;it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of&#xA;it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do&#xA;these things.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid&#xA;distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these&#xA;rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for&#xA;you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis&#xA;or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave&#xA;you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source&#xA;code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide&#xA;complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them&#xA;with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling&#xA;it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.&#xA;&#xA;  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the&#xA;library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal&#xA;permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that&#xA;there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is&#xA;modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know&#xA;that what they have is not the original version, so that the original&#xA;author&apos;s reputation will not be affected by problems that might be&#xA;introduced by others.&#xA;&#xA;  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of&#xA;any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot&#xA;effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a&#xA;restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that&#xA;any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be&#xA;consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.&#xA;&#xA;  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the&#xA;ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser&#xA;General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and&#xA;is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use&#xA;this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those&#xA;libraries into non-free programs.&#xA;&#xA;  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using&#xA;a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a&#xA;combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary&#xA;General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the&#xA;entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General&#xA;Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with&#xA;the library.&#xA;&#xA;  We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because it&#xA;does Less to protect the user&apos;s freedom than the ordinary General&#xA;Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less&#xA;of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages&#xA;are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many&#xA;libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain&#xA;special circumstances.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to&#xA;encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes&#xA;a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be&#xA;allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free&#xA;library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this&#xA;case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free&#xA;software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free&#xA;programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of&#xA;free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in&#xA;non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU&#xA;operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating&#xA;system.&#xA;&#xA;  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the&#xA;users&apos; freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is&#xA;linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run&#xA;that program using a modified version of the Library.&#xA;&#xA;  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a&#xA;&quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;.  The&#xA;former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must&#xA;be combined with the library in order to run.&#xA;&#xA;    GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION&#xA;&#xA;  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other&#xA;program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or&#xA;other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of&#xA;this Lesser General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;).&#xA;Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data&#xA;prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs&#xA;(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work&#xA;which has been distributed under these terms.  A &quot;work based on the&#xA;Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under&#xA;copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a&#xA;portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated&#xA;straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is&#xA;included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for&#xA;making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means&#xA;all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated&#xA;interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation&#xA;and installation of the library.&#xA;&#xA;  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not&#xA;covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of&#xA;running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from&#xA;such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based&#xA;on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for&#xA;writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does&#xA;and what the program that uses the Library does.&#xA;  &#xA;  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library&apos;s&#xA;complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that&#xA;you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an&#xA;appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact&#xA;all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any&#xA;warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the&#xA;Library.&#xA;&#xA;  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,&#xA;and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a&#xA;fee.&#xA;&#xA;  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion&#xA;of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and&#xA;distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1&#xA;above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;&#xA;    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.&#xA;&#xA;    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices&#xA;    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.&#xA;&#xA;    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no&#xA;    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.&#xA;&#xA;    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a&#xA;    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses&#xA;    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility&#xA;    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,&#xA;    in the event an application does not supply such function or&#xA;    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of&#xA;    its purpose remains meaningful.&#xA;&#xA;    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has&#xA;    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the&#xA;    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any&#xA;    application-supplied function or table used by this function must&#xA;    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square&#xA;    root function must still compute square roots.)&#xA;&#xA;These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If&#xA;identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,&#xA;and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in&#xA;themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those&#xA;sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you&#xA;distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based&#xA;on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of&#xA;this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the&#xA;entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote&#xA;it.&#xA;&#xA;Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest&#xA;your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to&#xA;exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or&#xA;collective works based on the Library.&#xA;&#xA;In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library&#xA;with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of&#xA;a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under&#xA;the scope of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public&#xA;License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do&#xA;this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so&#xA;that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,&#xA;instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the&#xA;ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify&#xA;that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in&#xA;these notices.&#xA;&#xA;  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for&#xA;that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all&#xA;subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.&#xA;&#xA;  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of&#xA;the Library into a program that is not a library.&#xA;&#xA;  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or&#xA;derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form&#xA;under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany&#xA;it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which&#xA;must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a&#xA;medium customarily used for software interchange.&#xA;&#xA;  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy&#xA;from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the&#xA;source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to&#xA;distribute the source code, even though third parties are not&#xA;compelled to copy the source along with the object code.&#xA;&#xA;  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the&#xA;Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or&#xA;linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;.  Such a&#xA;work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and&#xA;therefore falls outside the scope of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library&#xA;creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it&#xA;contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses the&#xA;library&quot;.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.&#xA;Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.&#xA;&#xA;  When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header file&#xA;that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a&#xA;derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.&#xA;Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be&#xA;linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The&#xA;threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.&#xA;&#xA;  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data&#xA;structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline&#xA;functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object&#xA;file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative&#xA;work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the&#xA;Library will still fall under Section 6.)&#xA;&#xA;  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may&#xA;distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.&#xA;Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,&#xA;whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.&#xA;&#xA;  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or&#xA;link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce a&#xA;work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work&#xA;under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit&#xA;modification of the work for the customer&apos;s own use and reverse&#xA;engineering for debugging such modifications.&#xA;&#xA;  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the&#xA;Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by&#xA;this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work&#xA;during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the&#xA;copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference&#xA;directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one&#xA;of these things:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding&#xA;    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever&#xA;    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under&#xA;    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked&#xA;    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that&#xA;    uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that the&#xA;    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified&#xA;    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood&#xA;    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the&#xA;    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application&#xA;    to use the modified definitions.)&#xA;&#xA;    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the&#xA;    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a&#xA;    copy of the library already present on the user&apos;s computer system,&#xA;    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)&#xA;    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if&#xA;    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is&#xA;    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.&#xA;&#xA;    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at&#xA;    least three years, to give the same user the materials&#xA;    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more&#xA;    than the cost of performing this distribution.&#xA;&#xA;    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy&#xA;    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above&#xA;    specified materials from the same place.&#xA;&#xA;    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these&#xA;    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.&#xA;&#xA;  For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the&#xA;Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for&#xA;reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,&#xA;the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is&#xA;normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major&#xA;components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on&#xA;which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies&#xA;the executable.&#xA;&#xA;  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license&#xA;restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally&#xA;accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot&#xA;use both them and the Library together in an executable that you&#xA;distribute.&#xA;&#xA;  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the&#xA;Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library&#xA;facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined&#xA;library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on&#xA;the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise&#xA;permitted, and provided that you do these two things:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work&#xA;    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library&#xA;    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the&#xA;    Sections above.&#xA;&#xA;    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact&#xA;    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining&#xA;    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.&#xA;&#xA;  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute&#xA;the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any&#xA;attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or&#xA;distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your&#xA;rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,&#xA;or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses&#xA;terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.&#xA;&#xA;  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not&#xA;signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or&#xA;distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are&#xA;prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by&#xA;modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the&#xA;Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and&#xA;all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying&#xA;the Library or works based on it.&#xA;&#xA;  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the&#xA;Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the&#xA;original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library&#xA;subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further&#xA;restrictions on the recipients&apos; exercise of the rights granted herein.&#xA;You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with&#xA;this License.&#xA;&#xA;  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent&#xA;infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),&#xA;conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot&#xA;distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you&#xA;may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent&#xA;license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by&#xA;all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then&#xA;the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to&#xA;refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.&#xA;&#xA;If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any&#xA;particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,&#xA;and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.&#xA;&#xA;It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any&#xA;patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any&#xA;such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the&#xA;integrity of the free software distribution system which is&#xA;implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made&#xA;generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed&#xA;through that system in reliance on consistent application of that&#xA;system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing&#xA;to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot&#xA;impose that choice.&#xA;&#xA;This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to&#xA;be a consequence of the rest of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in&#xA;certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the&#xA;original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add&#xA;an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,&#xA;so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus&#xA;excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if&#xA;written in the body of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new&#xA;versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.&#xA;Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,&#xA;but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.&#xA;&#xA;Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library&#xA;specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and&#xA;&quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and&#xA;conditions either of that version or of any later version published by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a&#xA;license version number, you may choose any version ever published by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation.&#xA;&#xA;  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free&#xA;programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,&#xA;write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is&#xA;copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free&#xA;Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our&#xA;decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status&#xA;of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing&#xA;and reuse of software generally.&#xA;&#xA;       NO WARRANTY&#xA;&#xA;  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO&#xA;WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.&#xA;EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR&#xA;OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY&#xA;KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE&#xA;IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#xA;PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE&#xA;LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME&#xA;THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;&#xA;  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN&#xA;WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY&#xA;AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU&#xA;FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR&#xA;CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE&#xA;LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING&#xA;RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A&#xA;FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF&#xA;SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH&#xA;DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;       END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;&#xA;           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries&#xA;&#xA;  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest&#xA;possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that&#xA;everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting&#xA;redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the&#xA;ordinary General Public License).&#xA;&#xA;  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is&#xA;safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively&#xA;convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the&#xA;&quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.&#xA;&#xA;    &lt;one line to give the library&apos;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;&#xA;    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;&#xA;&#xA;    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or&#xA;    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either&#xA;    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.&#xA;&#xA;    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,&#xA;    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of&#xA;    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU&#xA;    Lesser General Public License for more details.&#xA;&#xA;    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software&#xA;    Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA&#xA;&#xA;Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.&#xA;&#xA;You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your&#xA;school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the library, if&#xA;necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:&#xA;&#xA;  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the&#xA;  library `Frob&apos; (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.&#xA;&#xA;  &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1990&#xA;  Ty Coon, President of Vice&#xA;&#xA;That&apos;s all there is to it!

          GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 2.1, February 1999&#xA;&#xA;  Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 59&#xA;  Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA Everyone is&#xA;  permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license&#xA;  document, but changing it is not allowed.&#xA;&#xA;  [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also&#xA;  counts as the successor of the GNU Library Public License,&#xA;  version 2, hence the version number 2.1.]&#xA;&#xA;  Preamble&#xA;&#xA;  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your&#xA;  freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General&#xA;  Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share&#xA;  and change free software--to make sure the software is free for&#xA;  all its users.&#xA;&#xA;  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some&#xA;  specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of&#xA;  the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use&#xA;  it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully&#xA;  about whether this license or the ordinary General Public&#xA;  License is the better strategy to use in any particular case,&#xA;  based on the explanations below.&#xA;&#xA;  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of&#xA;  use, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make&#xA;  sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free&#xA;  software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you&#xA;  receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can&#xA;  change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs;&#xA;  and that you are informed that you can do these things.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid&#xA;  distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender&#xA;  these rights. These restrictions translate to certain&#xA;  responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library&#xA;  or if you modify it.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether&#xA;  gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights&#xA;  that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or&#xA;  can get the source code. If you link other code with the&#xA;  library, you must provide complete object files to the&#xA;  recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after&#xA;  making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must&#xA;  show them these terms so they know their rights.&#xA;&#xA;  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright&#xA;  the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you&#xA;  legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that&#xA;  there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library&#xA;  is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should&#xA;  know that what they have is not the original version, so that&#xA;  the original author&apos;s reputation will not be affected by&#xA;  problems that might be introduced by others.&#xA;&#xA;  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the&#xA;  existence of any free program. We wish to make sure that a&#xA;  company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program&#xA;  by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder.&#xA;  Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a&#xA;  version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom&#xA;  of use specified in this license.&#xA;&#xA;  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the&#xA;  ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU&#xA;  Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated&#xA;  libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General&#xA;  Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in&#xA;  order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.&#xA;&#xA;  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or&#xA;  using a shared library, the combination of the two is legally&#xA;  speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library.&#xA;  The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such&#xA;  linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of&#xA;  freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax&#xA;  criteria for linking other code with the library.&#xA;&#xA;  We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public&#xA;  License because it does Less to protect the user&apos;s freedom&#xA;  than the ordinary General Public License. It also provides other&#xA;  free software developers Less of an advantage over competing&#xA;  non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the&#xA;  ordinary General Public License for many libraries. However, the&#xA;  Lesser license provides advantages in certain special&#xA;  circumstances.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to&#xA;  encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that&#xA;  it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free&#xA;  programs must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent&#xA;  case is that a free library does the same job as widely used&#xA;  non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by&#xA;  limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the&#xA;  Lesser General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in&#xA;  non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a&#xA;  large body of free software. For example, permission to use the&#xA;  GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to&#xA;  use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the&#xA;  GNU/Linux operating system.&#xA;&#xA;  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of&#xA;  the users&apos; freedom, it does ensure that the user of a&#xA;  program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the&#xA;  wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the&#xA;  Library.&#xA;&#xA;  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;  modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference&#xA;  between a &quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work&#xA;  that uses the library&quot;. The former contains code derived&#xA;  from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the&#xA;  library in order to run.&#xA;&#xA;  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR&#xA;  COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION&#xA;&#xA;  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or&#xA;  other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright&#xA;  holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed&#xA;  under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also&#xA;  called &quot;this License&quot;). Each licensee is addressed as&#xA;  &quot;you&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions&#xA;  and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with&#xA;  application programs (which use some of those functions and&#xA;  data) to form executables.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software&#xA;  library or work which has been distributed under these terms. A&#xA;  &quot;work based on the Library&quot; means either the Library&#xA;  or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a&#xA;  work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim&#xA;  or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into&#xA;  another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without&#xA;  limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of&#xA;  the work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete&#xA;  source code means all the source code for all modules it&#xA;  contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus&#xA;  the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the&#xA;  library.&#xA;&#xA;  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are&#xA;  not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act&#xA;  of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and&#xA;  output from such a program is covered only if its contents&#xA;  constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use&#xA;  of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true&#xA;  depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses&#xA;  the Library does.&#xA;&#xA;  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the&#xA;  Library&apos;s complete source code as you receive it, in any&#xA;  medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately&#xA;  publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and&#xA;  disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer&#xA;  to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and&#xA;  distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.&#xA;&#xA;  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a&#xA;  copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in&#xA;  exchange for a fee.&#xA;&#xA;  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any&#xA;  portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and&#xA;  copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms&#xA;  of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these&#xA;  conditions:&#xA;&#xA;  a) The modified work must itself be a software library.&#xA;&#xA;  b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices&#xA;  stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.&#xA;&#xA;  c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no&#xA;  charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or&#xA;  a table of data to be supplied by an application program that&#xA;  uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the&#xA;  facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to&#xA;  ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such&#xA;  function or table, the facility still operates, and performs&#xA;  whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.&#xA;&#xA;  (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots&#xA;  has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the&#xA;  application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any&#xA;  application-supplied function or table used by this function&#xA;  must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the&#xA;  square root function must still compute square roots.)&#xA;&#xA;  These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If&#xA;  identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the&#xA;  Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and&#xA;  separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms,&#xA;  do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as&#xA;  separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as&#xA;  part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the&#xA;  distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License,&#xA;  whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire&#xA;  whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote&#xA;  it.&#xA;&#xA;  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or&#xA;  contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the&#xA;  intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of&#xA;  derivative or collective works based on the Library.&#xA;&#xA;  In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the&#xA;  Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library)&#xA;  on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring&#xA;  the other work under the scope of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General&#xA;  Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the&#xA;  Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer&#xA;  to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General&#xA;  Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a&#xA;  newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public&#xA;  License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead&#xA;  if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.&#xA;&#xA;  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for&#xA;  that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to&#xA;  all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.&#xA;&#xA;  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of&#xA;  the Library into a program that is not a library.&#xA;&#xA;  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or&#xA;  derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable&#xA;  form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you&#xA;  accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable&#xA;  source code, which must be distributed under the terms of&#xA;  Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software&#xA;  interchange.&#xA;&#xA;  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to&#xA;  copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to&#xA;  copy the source code from the same place satisfies the&#xA;  requirement to distribute the source code, even though third&#xA;  parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the&#xA;  object code.&#xA;&#xA;  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the&#xA;  Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being&#xA;  compiled or linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the&#xA;  Library&quot;. Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative&#xA;  work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of&#xA;  this License.&#xA;&#xA;  However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with&#xA;  the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the&#xA;  Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather&#xA;  than a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;. The executable is&#xA;  therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for&#xA;  distribution of such executables.&#xA;&#xA;  When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from&#xA;  a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for&#xA;  the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the&#xA;  source code is not. Whether this is true is especially&#xA;  significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if&#xA;  the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true&#xA;  is not precisely defined by law.&#xA;&#xA;  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data&#xA;  structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small&#xA;  inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of&#xA;  the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is&#xA;  legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object&#xA;  code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section&#xA;  6.)&#xA;&#xA;  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may&#xA;  distribute the object code for the work under the terms of&#xA;  Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under&#xA;  Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the&#xA;  Library itself.&#xA;&#xA;  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine&#xA;  or link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the&#xA;  Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library,&#xA;  and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided&#xA;  that the terms permit modification of the work for the&#xA;  customer&apos;s own use and reverse engineering for debugging&#xA;  such modifications.&#xA;&#xA;  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that&#xA;  the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are&#xA;  covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License.&#xA;  If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you&#xA;  must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as&#xA;  well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this&#xA;  License. Also, you must do one of these things:&#xA;&#xA;  a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding&#xA;  machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever&#xA;  changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under&#xA;  Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable&#xA;  linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable&#xA;  &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or&#xA;  source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then&#xA;  relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified&#xA;  Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the&#xA;  contents of definitions files in the Library will not&#xA;  necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the&#xA;  modified definitions.)&#xA;&#xA;  b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the&#xA;  Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a&#xA;  copy of the library already present on the user&apos;s computer&#xA;  system, rather than copying library functions into the&#xA;  executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified&#xA;  version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the&#xA;  modified version is interface-compatible with the version that&#xA;  the work was made with.&#xA;&#xA;  c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least&#xA;  three years, to give the same user the materials specified in&#xA;  Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of&#xA;  performing this distribution.&#xA;&#xA;  d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to&#xA;  copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy&#xA;  the above specified materials from the same place.&#xA;&#xA;  e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these&#xA;  materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.&#xA;&#xA;  For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses&#xA;  the Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs&#xA;  needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a&#xA;  special exception, the materials to be distributed need not&#xA;  include anything that is normally distributed (in either source&#xA;  or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and&#xA;  so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs,&#xA;  unless that component itself accompanies the executable.&#xA;&#xA;  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license&#xA;  restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally&#xA;  accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you&#xA;  cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable&#xA;  that you distribute.&#xA;&#xA;  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the&#xA;  Library side-by-side in a single library together with other&#xA;  library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute&#xA;  such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution&#xA;  of the work based on the Library and of the other library&#xA;  facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do&#xA;  these two things:&#xA;&#xA;  a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work&#xA;  based on the Library, uncombined with any other library&#xA;  facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the&#xA;  Sections above.&#xA;&#xA;  b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact&#xA;  that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining&#xA;  where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.&#xA;&#xA;  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or&#xA;  distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this&#xA;  License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link&#xA;  with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically&#xA;  terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who&#xA;  have received copies, or rights, from you under this License&#xA;  will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties&#xA;  remain in full compliance.&#xA;&#xA;  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have&#xA;  not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to&#xA;  modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These&#xA;  actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.&#xA;  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work&#xA;  based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this&#xA;  License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,&#xA;  distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.&#xA;&#xA;  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on&#xA;  the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license&#xA;  from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or&#xA;  modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You&#xA;  may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients&apos;&#xA;  exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible&#xA;  for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.&#xA;&#xA;  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of&#xA;  patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to&#xA;  patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court&#xA;  order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of&#xA;  this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this&#xA;  License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy&#xA;  simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other&#xA;  pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not&#xA;  distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license&#xA;  would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by&#xA;  all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you,&#xA;  then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License&#xA;  would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.&#xA;&#xA;  If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable&#xA;  under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is&#xA;  intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to&#xA;  apply in other circumstances.&#xA;&#xA;  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe&#xA;  any patents or other property right claims or to contest&#xA;  validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose&#xA;  of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution&#xA;  system which is implemented by public license practices. Many&#xA;  people have made generous contributions to the wide range of&#xA;  software distributed through that system in reliance on&#xA;  consistent application of that system; it is up to the&#xA;  author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute&#xA;  software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose&#xA;  that choice.&#xA;&#xA;  This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is&#xA;  believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted&#xA;  in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted&#xA;  interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library&#xA;  under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution&#xA;  limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is&#xA;  permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such&#xA;  case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in&#xA;  the body of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new&#xA;  versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.&#xA;  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present&#xA;  version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or&#xA;  concerns.&#xA;&#xA;  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the&#xA;  Library specifies a version number of this License which applies&#xA;  to it and &quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of&#xA;  following the terms and conditions either of that version or of&#xA;  any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If&#xA;  the Library does not specify a license version number, you may&#xA;  choose any version ever published by the Free Software&#xA;  Foundation.&#xA;&#xA;  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other&#xA;  free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible&#xA;  with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For&#xA;  software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation,&#xA;  write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make&#xA;  exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two&#xA;  goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our&#xA;  free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software&#xA;  generally.&#xA;&#xA;  NO WARRANTY&#xA;&#xA;  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO&#xA;  WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE&#xA;  LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT&#xA;  HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS&#xA;  IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR&#xA;  IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES&#xA;  OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE&#xA;  ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS&#xA;  WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE&#xA;  COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;&#xA;  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO&#xA;  IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY&#xA;  MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE&#xA;  LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,&#xA;  INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR&#xA;  INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS&#xA;  OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY&#xA;  YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH&#xA;  ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN&#xA;  ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;  END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;&#xA;  How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries&#xA;&#xA;  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the&#xA;  greatest possible use to the public, we recommend making it free&#xA;  software that everyone can redistribute and change. You can do&#xA;  so by permitting redistribution under these terms (or,&#xA;  alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public&#xA;  License).&#xA;&#xA;  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the&#xA;  library. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source&#xA;  file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and&#xA;  each file should have at least the &quot;copyright&quot; line&#xA;  and a pointer to where the full notice is found.&#xA;&#xA;  &lt;one line to give the library&apos;s name and a brief idea of&#xA;  what it does.&gt; Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt; &lt;name of&#xA;  author&gt;&#xA;&#xA;  This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or&#xA;  modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;  License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either&#xA;  version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later&#xA;  version.&#xA;&#xA;  This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,&#xA;  but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of&#xA;  MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU&#xA;  Lesser General Public License for more details.&#xA;&#xA;  You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;  License along with this library; if not, write to the Free&#xA;  Software Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston,&#xA;  MA 02111-1307 USA&#xA;&#xA;  Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and&#xA;  paper mail.&#xA;&#xA;  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer)&#xA;  or your school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright&#xA;  disclaimer&quot; for the library, if necessary. Here is a&#xA;  sample; alter the names:&#xA;&#xA;  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the&#xA;  library `Frob&apos; (a library for tweaking knobs) written by&#xA;  James Random Hacker.&#xA;&#xA;  &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1990 Ty Coon, President of&#xA;  Vice&#xA;&#xA;  That&apos;s all there is to it!

          GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;         Version 2.1, February 1999&#xA;&#xA; Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.&#xA;     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA&#xA; Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies&#xA; of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.&#xA;&#xA;[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts&#xA; as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence&#xA; the version number 2.1.]&#xA;&#xA;       Preamble&#xA;&#xA;  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your&#xA;freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public&#xA;Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change&#xA;free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.&#xA;&#xA;  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some&#xA;specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the&#xA;Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You&#xA;can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether&#xA;this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better&#xA;strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.&#xA;&#xA;  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,&#xA;not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that&#xA;you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge&#xA;for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get&#xA;it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of&#xA;it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do&#xA;these things.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid&#xA;distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these&#xA;rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for&#xA;you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis&#xA;or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave&#xA;you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source&#xA;code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide&#xA;complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them&#xA;with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling&#xA;it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.&#xA;&#xA;  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the&#xA;library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal&#xA;permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that&#xA;there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is&#xA;modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know&#xA;that what they have is not the original version, so that the original&#xA;author&apos;s reputation will not be affected by problems that might be&#xA;introduced by others.&#xA;&#xA;  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of&#xA;any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot&#xA;effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a&#xA;restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that&#xA;any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be&#xA;consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.&#xA;&#xA;  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the&#xA;ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser&#xA;General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and&#xA;is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use&#xA;this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those&#xA;libraries into non-free programs.&#xA;&#xA;  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using&#xA;a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a&#xA;combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary&#xA;General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the&#xA;entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General&#xA;Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with&#xA;the library.&#xA;&#xA;  We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because it&#xA;does Less to protect the user&apos;s freedom than the ordinary General&#xA;Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less&#xA;of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages&#xA;are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many&#xA;libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain&#xA;special circumstances.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to&#xA;encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes&#xA;a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be&#xA;allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free&#xA;library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this&#xA;case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free&#xA;software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free&#xA;programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of&#xA;free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in&#xA;non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU&#xA;operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating&#xA;system.&#xA;&#xA;  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the&#xA;users&apos; freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is&#xA;linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run&#xA;that program using a modified version of the Library.&#xA;&#xA;  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a&#xA;&quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;.  The&#xA;former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must&#xA;be combined with the library in order to run.&#xA;&#xA;    GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION&#xA;&#xA;  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other&#xA;program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or&#xA;other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of&#xA;this Lesser General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;).&#xA;Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data&#xA;prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs&#xA;(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work&#xA;which has been distributed under these terms.  A &quot;work based on the&#xA;Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under&#xA;copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a&#xA;portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated&#xA;straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is&#xA;included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for&#xA;making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means&#xA;all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated&#xA;interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation&#xA;and installation of the library.&#xA;&#xA;  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not&#xA;covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of&#xA;running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from&#xA;such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based&#xA;on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for&#xA;writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does&#xA;and what the program that uses the Library does.&#xA;  &#xA;  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library&apos;s&#xA;complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that&#xA;you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an&#xA;appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact&#xA;all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any&#xA;warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the&#xA;Library.&#xA;&#xA;  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,&#xA;and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a&#xA;fee.&#xA;&#xA;  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion&#xA;of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and&#xA;distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1&#xA;above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;&#xA;    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.&#xA;&#xA;    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices&#xA;    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.&#xA;&#xA;    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no&#xA;    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.&#xA;&#xA;    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a&#xA;    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses&#xA;    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility&#xA;    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,&#xA;    in the event an application does not supply such function or&#xA;    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of&#xA;    its purpose remains meaningful.&#xA;&#xA;    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has&#xA;    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the&#xA;    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any&#xA;    application-supplied function or table used by this function must&#xA;    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square&#xA;    root function must still compute square roots.)&#xA;&#xA;These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If&#xA;identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,&#xA;and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in&#xA;themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those&#xA;sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you&#xA;distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based&#xA;on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of&#xA;this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the&#xA;entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote&#xA;it.&#xA;&#xA;Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest&#xA;your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to&#xA;exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or&#xA;collective works based on the Library.&#xA;&#xA;In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library&#xA;with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of&#xA;a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under&#xA;the scope of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public&#xA;License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do&#xA;this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so&#xA;that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,&#xA;instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the&#xA;ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify&#xA;that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in&#xA;these notices.&#xA;&#xA;  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for&#xA;that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all&#xA;subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.&#xA;&#xA;  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of&#xA;the Library into a program that is not a library.&#xA;&#xA;  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or&#xA;derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form&#xA;under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany&#xA;it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which&#xA;must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a&#xA;medium customarily used for software interchange.&#xA;&#xA;  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy&#xA;from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the&#xA;source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to&#xA;distribute the source code, even though third parties are not&#xA;compelled to copy the source along with the object code.&#xA;&#xA;  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the&#xA;Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or&#xA;linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;.  Such a&#xA;work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and&#xA;therefore falls outside the scope of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library&#xA;creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it&#xA;contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses the&#xA;library&quot;.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.&#xA;Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.&#xA;&#xA;  When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header file&#xA;that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a&#xA;derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.&#xA;Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be&#xA;linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The&#xA;threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.&#xA;&#xA;  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data&#xA;structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline&#xA;functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object&#xA;file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative&#xA;work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the&#xA;Library will still fall under Section 6.)&#xA;&#xA;  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may&#xA;distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.&#xA;Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,&#xA;whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.&#xA;&#xA;  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or&#xA;link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce a&#xA;work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work&#xA;under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit&#xA;modification of the work for the customer&apos;s own use and reverse&#xA;engineering for debugging such modifications.&#xA;&#xA;  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the&#xA;Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by&#xA;this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work&#xA;during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the&#xA;copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference&#xA;directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one&#xA;of these things:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding&#xA;    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever&#xA;    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under&#xA;    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked&#xA;    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that&#xA;    uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that the&#xA;    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified&#xA;    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood&#xA;    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the&#xA;    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application&#xA;    to use the modified definitions.)&#xA;&#xA;    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the&#xA;    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a&#xA;    copy of the library already present on the user&apos;s computer system,&#xA;    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)&#xA;    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if&#xA;    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is&#xA;    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.&#xA;&#xA;    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at&#xA;    least three years, to give the same user the materials&#xA;    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more&#xA;    than the cost of performing this distribution.&#xA;&#xA;    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy&#xA;    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above&#xA;    specified materials from the same place.&#xA;&#xA;    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these&#xA;    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.&#xA;&#xA;  For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the&#xA;Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for&#xA;reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,&#xA;the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is&#xA;normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major&#xA;components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on&#xA;which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies&#xA;the executable.&#xA;&#xA;  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license&#xA;restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally&#xA;accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot&#xA;use both them and the Library together in an executable that you&#xA;distribute.&#xA;&#xA;  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the&#xA;Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library&#xA;facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined&#xA;library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on&#xA;the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise&#xA;permitted, and provided that you do these two things:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work&#xA;    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library&#xA;    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the&#xA;    Sections above.&#xA;&#xA;    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact&#xA;    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining&#xA;    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.&#xA;&#xA;  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute&#xA;the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any&#xA;attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or&#xA;distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your&#xA;rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,&#xA;or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses&#xA;terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.&#xA;&#xA;  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not&#xA;signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or&#xA;distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are&#xA;prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by&#xA;modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the&#xA;Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and&#xA;all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying&#xA;the Library or works based on it.&#xA;&#xA;  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the&#xA;Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the&#xA;original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library&#xA;subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further&#xA;restrictions on the recipients&apos; exercise of the rights granted herein.&#xA;You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with&#xA;this License.&#xA;&#xA;  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent&#xA;infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),&#xA;conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot&#xA;distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you&#xA;may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent&#xA;license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by&#xA;all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then&#xA;the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to&#xA;refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.&#xA;&#xA;If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any&#xA;particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,&#xA;and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.&#xA;&#xA;It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any&#xA;patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any&#xA;such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the&#xA;integrity of the free software distribution system which is&#xA;implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made&#xA;generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed&#xA;through that system in reliance on consistent application of that&#xA;system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing&#xA;to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot&#xA;impose that choice.&#xA;&#xA;This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to&#xA;be a consequence of the rest of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in&#xA;certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the&#xA;original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add&#xA;an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,&#xA;so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus&#xA;excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if&#xA;written in the body of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new&#xA;versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.&#xA;Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,&#xA;but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.&#xA;&#xA;Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library&#xA;specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and&#xA;&quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and&#xA;conditions either of that version or of any later version published by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a&#xA;license version number, you may choose any version ever published by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation.&#xA;&#xA;  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free&#xA;programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,&#xA;write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is&#xA;copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free&#xA;Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our&#xA;decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status&#xA;of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing&#xA;and reuse of software generally.&#xA;&#xA;       NO WARRANTY&#xA;&#xA;  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO&#xA;WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.&#xA;EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR&#xA;OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY&#xA;KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE&#xA;IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#xA;PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE&#xA;LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME&#xA;THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;&#xA;  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN&#xA;WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY&#xA;AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU&#xA;FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR&#xA;CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE&#xA;LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING&#xA;RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A&#xA;FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF&#xA;SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH&#xA;DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;       END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;&#xA;           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries&#xA;&#xA;  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest&#xA;possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that&#xA;everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting&#xA;redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the&#xA;ordinary General Public License).&#xA;&#xA;  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is&#xA;safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively&#xA;convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the&#xA;&quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.&#xA;&#xA;    &lt;one line to give the library&apos;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;&#xA;    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;&#xA;&#xA;    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or&#xA;    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either&#xA;    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.&#xA;&#xA;    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,&#xA;    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of&#xA;    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU&#xA;    Lesser General Public License for more details.&#xA;&#xA;    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software&#xA;    Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA&#xA;&#xA;Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.&#xA;&#xA;You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your&#xA;school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the library, if&#xA;necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:&#xA;&#xA;  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the&#xA;  library `Frob&apos; (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.&#xA;&#xA;  &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1990&#xA;  Ty Coon, President of Vice&#xA;&#xA;That&apos;s all there is to it!

          GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 2.1, February 1999&#xA;&#xA;  Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 59&#xA;  Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA Everyone is&#xA;  permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license&#xA;  document, but changing it is not allowed.&#xA;&#xA;  [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also&#xA;  counts as the successor of the GNU Library Public License,&#xA;  version 2, hence the version number 2.1.]&#xA;&#xA;  Preamble&#xA;&#xA;  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your&#xA;  freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General&#xA;  Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share&#xA;  and change free software--to make sure the software is free for&#xA;  all its users.&#xA;&#xA;  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some&#xA;  specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of&#xA;  the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use&#xA;  it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully&#xA;  about whether this license or the ordinary General Public&#xA;  License is the better strategy to use in any particular case,&#xA;  based on the explanations below.&#xA;&#xA;  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of&#xA;  use, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make&#xA;  sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free&#xA;  software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you&#xA;  receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can&#xA;  change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs;&#xA;  and that you are informed that you can do these things.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid&#xA;  distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender&#xA;  these rights. These restrictions translate to certain&#xA;  responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library&#xA;  or if you modify it.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether&#xA;  gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights&#xA;  that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or&#xA;  can get the source code. If you link other code with the&#xA;  library, you must provide complete object files to the&#xA;  recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after&#xA;  making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must&#xA;  show them these terms so they know their rights.&#xA;&#xA;  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright&#xA;  the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you&#xA;  legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that&#xA;  there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library&#xA;  is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should&#xA;  know that what they have is not the original version, so that&#xA;  the original author&apos;s reputation will not be affected by&#xA;  problems that might be introduced by others.&#xA;&#xA;  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the&#xA;  existence of any free program. We wish to make sure that a&#xA;  company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program&#xA;  by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder.&#xA;  Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a&#xA;  version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom&#xA;  of use specified in this license.&#xA;&#xA;  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the&#xA;  ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU&#xA;  Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated&#xA;  libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General&#xA;  Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in&#xA;  order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.&#xA;&#xA;  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or&#xA;  using a shared library, the combination of the two is legally&#xA;  speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library.&#xA;  The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such&#xA;  linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of&#xA;  freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax&#xA;  criteria for linking other code with the library.&#xA;&#xA;  We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public&#xA;  License because it does Less to protect the user&apos;s freedom&#xA;  than the ordinary General Public License. It also provides other&#xA;  free software developers Less of an advantage over competing&#xA;  non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the&#xA;  ordinary General Public License for many libraries. However, the&#xA;  Lesser license provides advantages in certain special&#xA;  circumstances.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to&#xA;  encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that&#xA;  it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free&#xA;  programs must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent&#xA;  case is that a free library does the same job as widely used&#xA;  non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by&#xA;  limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the&#xA;  Lesser General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in&#xA;  non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a&#xA;  large body of free software. For example, permission to use the&#xA;  GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to&#xA;  use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the&#xA;  GNU/Linux operating system.&#xA;&#xA;  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of&#xA;  the users&apos; freedom, it does ensure that the user of a&#xA;  program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the&#xA;  wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the&#xA;  Library.&#xA;&#xA;  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;  modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference&#xA;  between a &quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work&#xA;  that uses the library&quot;. The former contains code derived&#xA;  from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the&#xA;  library in order to run.&#xA;&#xA;  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR&#xA;  COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION&#xA;&#xA;  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or&#xA;  other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright&#xA;  holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed&#xA;  under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also&#xA;  called &quot;this License&quot;). Each licensee is addressed as&#xA;  &quot;you&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions&#xA;  and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with&#xA;  application programs (which use some of those functions and&#xA;  data) to form executables.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software&#xA;  library or work which has been distributed under these terms. A&#xA;  &quot;work based on the Library&quot; means either the Library&#xA;  or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a&#xA;  work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim&#xA;  or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into&#xA;  another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without&#xA;  limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of&#xA;  the work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete&#xA;  source code means all the source code for all modules it&#xA;  contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus&#xA;  the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the&#xA;  library.&#xA;&#xA;  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are&#xA;  not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act&#xA;  of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and&#xA;  output from such a program is covered only if its contents&#xA;  constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use&#xA;  of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true&#xA;  depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses&#xA;  the Library does.&#xA;&#xA;  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the&#xA;  Library&apos;s complete source code as you receive it, in any&#xA;  medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately&#xA;  publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and&#xA;  disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer&#xA;  to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and&#xA;  distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.&#xA;&#xA;  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a&#xA;  copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in&#xA;  exchange for a fee.&#xA;&#xA;  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any&#xA;  portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and&#xA;  copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms&#xA;  of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these&#xA;  conditions:&#xA;&#xA;  a) The modified work must itself be a software library.&#xA;&#xA;  b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices&#xA;  stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.&#xA;&#xA;  c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no&#xA;  charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or&#xA;  a table of data to be supplied by an application program that&#xA;  uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the&#xA;  facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to&#xA;  ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such&#xA;  function or table, the facility still operates, and performs&#xA;  whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.&#xA;&#xA;  (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots&#xA;  has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the&#xA;  application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any&#xA;  application-supplied function or table used by this function&#xA;  must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the&#xA;  square root function must still compute square roots.)&#xA;&#xA;  These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If&#xA;  identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the&#xA;  Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and&#xA;  separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms,&#xA;  do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as&#xA;  separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as&#xA;  part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the&#xA;  distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License,&#xA;  whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire&#xA;  whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote&#xA;  it.&#xA;&#xA;  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or&#xA;  contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the&#xA;  intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of&#xA;  derivative or collective works based on the Library.&#xA;&#xA;  In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the&#xA;  Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library)&#xA;  on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring&#xA;  the other work under the scope of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General&#xA;  Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the&#xA;  Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer&#xA;  to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General&#xA;  Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a&#xA;  newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public&#xA;  License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead&#xA;  if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.&#xA;&#xA;  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for&#xA;  that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to&#xA;  all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.&#xA;&#xA;  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of&#xA;  the Library into a program that is not a library.&#xA;&#xA;  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or&#xA;  derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable&#xA;  form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you&#xA;  accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable&#xA;  source code, which must be distributed under the terms of&#xA;  Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software&#xA;  interchange.&#xA;&#xA;  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to&#xA;  copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to&#xA;  copy the source code from the same place satisfies the&#xA;  requirement to distribute the source code, even though third&#xA;  parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the&#xA;  object code.&#xA;&#xA;  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the&#xA;  Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being&#xA;  compiled or linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the&#xA;  Library&quot;. Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative&#xA;  work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of&#xA;  this License.&#xA;&#xA;  However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with&#xA;  the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the&#xA;  Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather&#xA;  than a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;. The executable is&#xA;  therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for&#xA;  distribution of such executables.&#xA;&#xA;  When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from&#xA;  a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for&#xA;  the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the&#xA;  source code is not. Whether this is true is especially&#xA;  significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if&#xA;  the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true&#xA;  is not precisely defined by law.&#xA;&#xA;  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data&#xA;  structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small&#xA;  inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of&#xA;  the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is&#xA;  legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object&#xA;  code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section&#xA;  6.)&#xA;&#xA;  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may&#xA;  distribute the object code for the work under the terms of&#xA;  Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under&#xA;  Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the&#xA;  Library itself.&#xA;&#xA;  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine&#xA;  or link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the&#xA;  Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library,&#xA;  and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided&#xA;  that the terms permit modification of the work for the&#xA;  customer&apos;s own use and reverse engineering for debugging&#xA;  such modifications.&#xA;&#xA;  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that&#xA;  the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are&#xA;  covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License.&#xA;  If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you&#xA;  must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as&#xA;  well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this&#xA;  License. Also, you must do one of these things:&#xA;&#xA;  a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding&#xA;  machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever&#xA;  changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under&#xA;  Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable&#xA;  linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable&#xA;  &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or&#xA;  source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then&#xA;  relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified&#xA;  Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the&#xA;  contents of definitions files in the Library will not&#xA;  necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the&#xA;  modified definitions.)&#xA;&#xA;  b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the&#xA;  Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a&#xA;  copy of the library already present on the user&apos;s computer&#xA;  system, rather than copying library functions into the&#xA;  executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified&#xA;  version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the&#xA;  modified version is interface-compatible with the version that&#xA;  the work was made with.&#xA;&#xA;  c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least&#xA;  three years, to give the same user the materials specified in&#xA;  Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of&#xA;  performing this distribution.&#xA;&#xA;  d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to&#xA;  copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy&#xA;  the above specified materials from the same place.&#xA;&#xA;  e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these&#xA;  materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.&#xA;&#xA;  For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses&#xA;  the Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs&#xA;  needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a&#xA;  special exception, the materials to be distributed need not&#xA;  include anything that is normally distributed (in either source&#xA;  or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and&#xA;  so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs,&#xA;  unless that component itself accompanies the executable.&#xA;&#xA;  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license&#xA;  restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally&#xA;  accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you&#xA;  cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable&#xA;  that you distribute.&#xA;&#xA;  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the&#xA;  Library side-by-side in a single library together with other&#xA;  library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute&#xA;  such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution&#xA;  of the work based on the Library and of the other library&#xA;  facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do&#xA;  these two things:&#xA;&#xA;  a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work&#xA;  based on the Library, uncombined with any other library&#xA;  facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the&#xA;  Sections above.&#xA;&#xA;  b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact&#xA;  that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining&#xA;  where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.&#xA;&#xA;  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or&#xA;  distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this&#xA;  License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link&#xA;  with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically&#xA;  terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who&#xA;  have received copies, or rights, from you under this License&#xA;  will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties&#xA;  remain in full compliance.&#xA;&#xA;  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have&#xA;  not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to&#xA;  modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These&#xA;  actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.&#xA;  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work&#xA;  based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this&#xA;  License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,&#xA;  distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.&#xA;&#xA;  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on&#xA;  the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license&#xA;  from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or&#xA;  modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You&#xA;  may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients&apos;&#xA;  exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible&#xA;  for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.&#xA;&#xA;  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of&#xA;  patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to&#xA;  patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court&#xA;  order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of&#xA;  this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this&#xA;  License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy&#xA;  simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other&#xA;  pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not&#xA;  distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license&#xA;  would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by&#xA;  all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you,&#xA;  then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License&#xA;  would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.&#xA;&#xA;  If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable&#xA;  under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is&#xA;  intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to&#xA;  apply in other circumstances.&#xA;&#xA;  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe&#xA;  any patents or other property right claims or to contest&#xA;  validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose&#xA;  of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution&#xA;  system which is implemented by public license practices. Many&#xA;  people have made generous contributions to the wide range of&#xA;  software distributed through that system in reliance on&#xA;  consistent application of that system; it is up to the&#xA;  author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute&#xA;  software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose&#xA;  that choice.&#xA;&#xA;  This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is&#xA;  believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted&#xA;  in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted&#xA;  interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library&#xA;  under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution&#xA;  limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is&#xA;  permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such&#xA;  case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in&#xA;  the body of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new&#xA;  versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.&#xA;  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present&#xA;  version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or&#xA;  concerns.&#xA;&#xA;  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the&#xA;  Library specifies a version number of this License which applies&#xA;  to it and &quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of&#xA;  following the terms and conditions either of that version or of&#xA;  any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If&#xA;  the Library does not specify a license version number, you may&#xA;  choose any version ever published by the Free Software&#xA;  Foundation.&#xA;&#xA;  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other&#xA;  free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible&#xA;  with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For&#xA;  software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation,&#xA;  write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make&#xA;  exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two&#xA;  goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our&#xA;  free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software&#xA;  generally.&#xA;&#xA;  NO WARRANTY&#xA;&#xA;  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO&#xA;  WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE&#xA;  LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT&#xA;  HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS&#xA;  IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR&#xA;  IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES&#xA;  OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE&#xA;  ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS&#xA;  WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE&#xA;  COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;&#xA;  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO&#xA;  IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY&#xA;  MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE&#xA;  LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,&#xA;  INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR&#xA;  INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS&#xA;  OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY&#xA;  YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH&#xA;  ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN&#xA;  ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;  END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;&#xA;  How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries&#xA;&#xA;  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the&#xA;  greatest possible use to the public, we recommend making it free&#xA;  software that everyone can redistribute and change. You can do&#xA;  so by permitting redistribution under these terms (or,&#xA;  alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public&#xA;  License).&#xA;&#xA;  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the&#xA;  library. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source&#xA;  file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and&#xA;  each file should have at least the &quot;copyright&quot; line&#xA;  and a pointer to where the full notice is found.&#xA;&#xA;  &lt;one line to give the library&apos;s name and a brief idea of&#xA;  what it does.&gt; Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt; &lt;name of&#xA;  author&gt;&#xA;&#xA;  This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or&#xA;  modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;  License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either&#xA;  version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later&#xA;  version.&#xA;&#xA;  This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,&#xA;  but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of&#xA;  MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU&#xA;  Lesser General Public License for more details.&#xA;&#xA;  You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;  License along with this library; if not, write to the Free&#xA;  Software Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston,&#xA;  MA 02111-1307 USA&#xA;&#xA;  Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and&#xA;  paper mail.&#xA;&#xA;  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer)&#xA;  or your school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright&#xA;  disclaimer&quot; for the library, if necessary. Here is a&#xA;  sample; alter the names:&#xA;&#xA;  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the&#xA;  library `Frob&apos; (a library for tweaking knobs) written by&#xA;  James Random Hacker.&#xA;&#xA;  &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1990 Ty Coon, President of&#xA;  Vice&#xA;&#xA;  That&apos;s all there is to it!

          GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 2.1, February 1999&#xA;&#xA;  Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 59&#xA;  Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA Everyone is&#xA;  permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license&#xA;  document, but changing it is not allowed.&#xA;&#xA;  [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also&#xA;  counts as the successor of the GNU Library Public License,&#xA;  version 2, hence the version number 2.1.]&#xA;&#xA;  Preamble&#xA;&#xA;  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your&#xA;  freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General&#xA;  Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share&#xA;  and change free software--to make sure the software is free for&#xA;  all its users.&#xA;&#xA;  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some&#xA;  specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of&#xA;  the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use&#xA;  it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully&#xA;  about whether this license or the ordinary General Public&#xA;  License is the better strategy to use in any particular case,&#xA;  based on the explanations below.&#xA;&#xA;  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of&#xA;  use, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make&#xA;  sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free&#xA;  software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you&#xA;  receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can&#xA;  change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs;&#xA;  and that you are informed that you can do these things.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid&#xA;  distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender&#xA;  these rights. These restrictions translate to certain&#xA;  responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library&#xA;  or if you modify it.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether&#xA;  gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights&#xA;  that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or&#xA;  can get the source code. If you link other code with the&#xA;  library, you must provide complete object files to the&#xA;  recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after&#xA;  making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must&#xA;  show them these terms so they know their rights.&#xA;&#xA;  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright&#xA;  the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you&#xA;  legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that&#xA;  there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library&#xA;  is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should&#xA;  know that what they have is not the original version, so that&#xA;  the original author&apos;s reputation will not be affected by&#xA;  problems that might be introduced by others.&#xA;&#xA;  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the&#xA;  existence of any free program. We wish to make sure that a&#xA;  company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program&#xA;  by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder.&#xA;  Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a&#xA;  version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom&#xA;  of use specified in this license.&#xA;&#xA;  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the&#xA;  ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU&#xA;  Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated&#xA;  libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General&#xA;  Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in&#xA;  order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.&#xA;&#xA;  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or&#xA;  using a shared library, the combination of the two is legally&#xA;  speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library.&#xA;  The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such&#xA;  linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of&#xA;  freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax&#xA;  criteria for linking other code with the library.&#xA;&#xA;  We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public&#xA;  License because it does Less to protect the user&apos;s freedom&#xA;  than the ordinary General Public License. It also provides other&#xA;  free software developers Less of an advantage over competing&#xA;  non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the&#xA;  ordinary General Public License for many libraries. However, the&#xA;  Lesser license provides advantages in certain special&#xA;  circumstances.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to&#xA;  encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that&#xA;  it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free&#xA;  programs must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent&#xA;  case is that a free library does the same job as widely used&#xA;  non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by&#xA;  limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the&#xA;  Lesser General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in&#xA;  non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a&#xA;  large body of free software. For example, permission to use the&#xA;  GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to&#xA;  use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the&#xA;  GNU/Linux operating system.&#xA;&#xA;  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of&#xA;  the users&apos; freedom, it does ensure that the user of a&#xA;  program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the&#xA;  wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the&#xA;  Library.&#xA;&#xA;  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;  modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference&#xA;  between a &quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work&#xA;  that uses the library&quot;. The former contains code derived&#xA;  from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the&#xA;  library in order to run.&#xA;&#xA;  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR&#xA;  COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION&#xA;&#xA;  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or&#xA;  other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright&#xA;  holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed&#xA;  under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also&#xA;  called &quot;this License&quot;). Each licensee is addressed as&#xA;  &quot;you&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions&#xA;  and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with&#xA;  application programs (which use some of those functions and&#xA;  data) to form executables.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software&#xA;  library or work which has been distributed under these terms. A&#xA;  &quot;work based on the Library&quot; means either the Library&#xA;  or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a&#xA;  work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim&#xA;  or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into&#xA;  another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without&#xA;  limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of&#xA;  the work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete&#xA;  source code means all the source code for all modules it&#xA;  contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus&#xA;  the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the&#xA;  library.&#xA;&#xA;  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are&#xA;  not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act&#xA;  of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and&#xA;  output from such a program is covered only if its contents&#xA;  constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use&#xA;  of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true&#xA;  depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses&#xA;  the Library does.&#xA;&#xA;  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the&#xA;  Library&apos;s complete source code as you receive it, in any&#xA;  medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately&#xA;  publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and&#xA;  disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer&#xA;  to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and&#xA;  distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.&#xA;&#xA;  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a&#xA;  copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in&#xA;  exchange for a fee.&#xA;&#xA;  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any&#xA;  portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and&#xA;  copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms&#xA;  of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these&#xA;  conditions:&#xA;&#xA;  a) The modified work must itself be a software library.&#xA;&#xA;  b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices&#xA;  stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.&#xA;&#xA;  c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no&#xA;  charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or&#xA;  a table of data to be supplied by an application program that&#xA;  uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the&#xA;  facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to&#xA;  ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such&#xA;  function or table, the facility still operates, and performs&#xA;  whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.&#xA;&#xA;  (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots&#xA;  has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the&#xA;  application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any&#xA;  application-supplied function or table used by this function&#xA;  must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the&#xA;  square root function must still compute square roots.)&#xA;&#xA;  These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If&#xA;  identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the&#xA;  Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and&#xA;  separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms,&#xA;  do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as&#xA;  separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as&#xA;  part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the&#xA;  distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License,&#xA;  whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire&#xA;  whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote&#xA;  it.&#xA;&#xA;  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or&#xA;  contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the&#xA;  intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of&#xA;  derivative or collective works based on the Library.&#xA;&#xA;  In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the&#xA;  Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library)&#xA;  on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring&#xA;  the other work under the scope of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General&#xA;  Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the&#xA;  Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer&#xA;  to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General&#xA;  Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a&#xA;  newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public&#xA;  License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead&#xA;  if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.&#xA;&#xA;  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for&#xA;  that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to&#xA;  all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.&#xA;&#xA;  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of&#xA;  the Library into a program that is not a library.&#xA;&#xA;  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or&#xA;  derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable&#xA;  form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you&#xA;  accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable&#xA;  source code, which must be distributed under the terms of&#xA;  Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software&#xA;  interchange.&#xA;&#xA;  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to&#xA;  copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to&#xA;  copy the source code from the same place satisfies the&#xA;  requirement to distribute the source code, even though third&#xA;  parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the&#xA;  object code.&#xA;&#xA;  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the&#xA;  Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being&#xA;  compiled or linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the&#xA;  Library&quot;. Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative&#xA;  work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of&#xA;  this License.&#xA;&#xA;  However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with&#xA;  the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the&#xA;  Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather&#xA;  than a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;. The executable is&#xA;  therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for&#xA;  distribution of such executables.&#xA;&#xA;  When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from&#xA;  a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for&#xA;  the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the&#xA;  source code is not. Whether this is true is especially&#xA;  significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if&#xA;  the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true&#xA;  is not precisely defined by law.&#xA;&#xA;  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data&#xA;  structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small&#xA;  inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of&#xA;  the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is&#xA;  legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object&#xA;  code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section&#xA;  6.)&#xA;&#xA;  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may&#xA;  distribute the object code for the work under the terms of&#xA;  Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under&#xA;  Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the&#xA;  Library itself.&#xA;&#xA;  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine&#xA;  or link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the&#xA;  Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library,&#xA;  and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided&#xA;  that the terms permit modification of the work for the&#xA;  customer&apos;s own use and reverse engineering for debugging&#xA;  such modifications.&#xA;&#xA;  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that&#xA;  the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are&#xA;  covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License.&#xA;  If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you&#xA;  must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as&#xA;  well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this&#xA;  License. Also, you must do one of these things:&#xA;&#xA;  a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding&#xA;  machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever&#xA;  changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under&#xA;  Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable&#xA;  linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable&#xA;  &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or&#xA;  source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then&#xA;  relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified&#xA;  Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the&#xA;  contents of definitions files in the Library will not&#xA;  necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the&#xA;  modified definitions.)&#xA;&#xA;  b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the&#xA;  Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a&#xA;  copy of the library already present on the user&apos;s computer&#xA;  system, rather than copying library functions into the&#xA;  executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified&#xA;  version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the&#xA;  modified version is interface-compatible with the version that&#xA;  the work was made with.&#xA;&#xA;  c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least&#xA;  three years, to give the same user the materials specified in&#xA;  Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of&#xA;  performing this distribution.&#xA;&#xA;  d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to&#xA;  copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy&#xA;  the above specified materials from the same place.&#xA;&#xA;  e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these&#xA;  materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.&#xA;&#xA;  For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses&#xA;  the Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs&#xA;  needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a&#xA;  special exception, the materials to be distributed need not&#xA;  include anything that is normally distributed (in either source&#xA;  or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and&#xA;  so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs,&#xA;  unless that component itself accompanies the executable.&#xA;&#xA;  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license&#xA;  restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally&#xA;  accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you&#xA;  cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable&#xA;  that you distribute.&#xA;&#xA;  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the&#xA;  Library side-by-side in a single library together with other&#xA;  library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute&#xA;  such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution&#xA;  of the work based on the Library and of the other library&#xA;  facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do&#xA;  these two things:&#xA;&#xA;  a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work&#xA;  based on the Library, uncombined with any other library&#xA;  facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the&#xA;  Sections above.&#xA;&#xA;  b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact&#xA;  that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining&#xA;  where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.&#xA;&#xA;  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or&#xA;  distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this&#xA;  License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link&#xA;  with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically&#xA;  terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who&#xA;  have received copies, or rights, from you under this License&#xA;  will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties&#xA;  remain in full compliance.&#xA;&#xA;  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have&#xA;  not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to&#xA;  modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These&#xA;  actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.&#xA;  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work&#xA;  based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this&#xA;  License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,&#xA;  distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.&#xA;&#xA;  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on&#xA;  the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license&#xA;  from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or&#xA;  modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You&#xA;  may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients&apos;&#xA;  exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible&#xA;  for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.&#xA;&#xA;  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of&#xA;  patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to&#xA;  patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court&#xA;  order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of&#xA;  this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this&#xA;  License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy&#xA;  simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other&#xA;  pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not&#xA;  distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license&#xA;  would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by&#xA;  all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you,&#xA;  then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License&#xA;  would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.&#xA;&#xA;  If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable&#xA;  under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is&#xA;  intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to&#xA;  apply in other circumstances.&#xA;&#xA;  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe&#xA;  any patents or other property right claims or to contest&#xA;  validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose&#xA;  of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution&#xA;  system which is implemented by public license practices. Many&#xA;  people have made generous contributions to the wide range of&#xA;  software distributed through that system in reliance on&#xA;  consistent application of that system; it is up to the&#xA;  author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute&#xA;  software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose&#xA;  that choice.&#xA;&#xA;  This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is&#xA;  believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted&#xA;  in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted&#xA;  interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library&#xA;  under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution&#xA;  limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is&#xA;  permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such&#xA;  case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in&#xA;  the body of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new&#xA;  versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.&#xA;  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present&#xA;  version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or&#xA;  concerns.&#xA;&#xA;  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the&#xA;  Library specifies a version number of this License which applies&#xA;  to it and &quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of&#xA;  following the terms and conditions either of that version or of&#xA;  any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If&#xA;  the Library does not specify a license version number, you may&#xA;  choose any version ever published by the Free Software&#xA;  Foundation.&#xA;&#xA;  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other&#xA;  free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible&#xA;  with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For&#xA;  software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation,&#xA;  write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make&#xA;  exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two&#xA;  goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our&#xA;  free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software&#xA;  generally.&#xA;&#xA;  NO WARRANTY&#xA;&#xA;  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO&#xA;  WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE&#xA;  LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT&#xA;  HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS&#xA;  IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR&#xA;  IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES&#xA;  OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE&#xA;  ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS&#xA;  WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE&#xA;  COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;&#xA;  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO&#xA;  IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY&#xA;  MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE&#xA;  LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,&#xA;  INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR&#xA;  INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS&#xA;  OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY&#xA;  YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH&#xA;  ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN&#xA;  ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;  END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;&#xA;  How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries&#xA;&#xA;  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the&#xA;  greatest possible use to the public, we recommend making it free&#xA;  software that everyone can redistribute and change. You can do&#xA;  so by permitting redistribution under these terms (or,&#xA;  alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public&#xA;  License).&#xA;&#xA;  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the&#xA;  library. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source&#xA;  file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and&#xA;  each file should have at least the &quot;copyright&quot; line&#xA;  and a pointer to where the full notice is found.&#xA;&#xA;  &lt;one line to give the library&apos;s name and a brief idea of&#xA;  what it does.&gt; Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt; &lt;name of&#xA;  author&gt;&#xA;&#xA;  This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or&#xA;  modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;  License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either&#xA;  version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later&#xA;  version.&#xA;&#xA;  This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,&#xA;  but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of&#xA;  MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

          GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;         Version 2.1, February 1999&#xA;&#xA; Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.&#xA;     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA&#xA; Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies&#xA; of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.&#xA;&#xA;[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts&#xA; as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence&#xA; the version number 2.1.]&#xA;&#xA;       Preamble&#xA;&#xA;  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your&#xA;freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public&#xA;Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change&#xA;free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.&#xA;&#xA;  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some&#xA;specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the&#xA;Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You&#xA;can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether&#xA;this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better&#xA;strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.&#xA;&#xA;  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,&#xA;not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that&#xA;you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge&#xA;for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get&#xA;it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of&#xA;it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do&#xA;these things.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid&#xA;distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these&#xA;rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for&#xA;you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis&#xA;or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave&#xA;you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source&#xA;code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide&#xA;complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them&#xA;with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling&#xA;it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.&#xA;&#xA;  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the&#xA;library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal&#xA;permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that&#xA;there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is&#xA;modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know&#xA;that what they have is not the original version, so that the original&#xA;author&apos;s reputation will not be affected by problems that might be&#xA;introduced by others.&#xA;&#xA;  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of&#xA;any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot&#xA;effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a&#xA;restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that&#xA;any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be&#xA;consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.&#xA;&#xA;  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the&#xA;ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser&#xA;General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and&#xA;is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use&#xA;this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those&#xA;libraries into non-free programs.&#xA;&#xA;  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using&#xA;a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a&#xA;combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary&#xA;General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the&#xA;entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General&#xA;Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with&#xA;the library.&#xA;&#xA;  We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because it&#xA;does Less to protect the user&apos;s freedom than the ordinary General&#xA;Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less&#xA;of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages&#xA;are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many&#xA;libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain&#xA;special circumstances.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to&#xA;encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes&#xA;a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be&#xA;allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free&#xA;library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this&#xA;case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free&#xA;software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free&#xA;programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of&#xA;free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in&#xA;non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU&#xA;operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating&#xA;system.&#xA;&#xA;  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the&#xA;users&apos; freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is&#xA;linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run&#xA;that program using a modified version of the Library.&#xA;&#xA;  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a&#xA;&quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;.  The&#xA;former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must&#xA;be combined with the library in order to run.&#xA;&#xA;    GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION&#xA;&#xA;  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other&#xA;program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or&#xA;other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of&#xA;this Lesser General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;).&#xA;Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data&#xA;prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs&#xA;(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work&#xA;which has been distributed under these terms.  A &quot;work based on the&#xA;Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under&#xA;copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a&#xA;portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated&#xA;straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is&#xA;included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for&#xA;making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means&#xA;all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated&#xA;interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation&#xA;and installation of the library.&#xA;&#xA;  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not&#xA;covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of&#xA;running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from&#xA;such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based&#xA;on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for&#xA;writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does&#xA;and what the program that uses the Library does.&#xA;  &#xA;  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library&apos;s&#xA;complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that&#xA;you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an&#xA;appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact&#xA;all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any&#xA;warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the&#xA;Library.&#xA;&#xA;  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,&#xA;and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a&#xA;fee.&#xA;&#xA;  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion&#xA;of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and&#xA;distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1&#xA;above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;&#xA;    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.&#xA;&#xA;    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices&#xA;    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.&#xA;&#xA;    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no&#xA;    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.&#xA;&#xA;    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a&#xA;    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses&#xA;    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility&#xA;    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,&#xA;    in the event an application does not supply such function or&#xA;    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of&#xA;    its purpose remains meaningful.&#xA;&#xA;    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has&#xA;    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the&#xA;    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any&#xA;    application-supplied function or table used by this function must&#xA;    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square&#xA;    root function must still compute square roots.)&#xA;&#xA;These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If&#xA;identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,&#xA;and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in&#xA;themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those&#xA;sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you&#xA;distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based&#xA;on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of&#xA;this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the&#xA;entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote&#xA;it.&#xA;&#xA;Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest&#xA;your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to&#xA;exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or&#xA;collective works based on the Library.&#xA;&#xA;In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library&#xA;with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of&#xA;a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under&#xA;the scope of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public&#xA;License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do&#xA;this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so&#xA;that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,&#xA;instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the&#xA;ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify&#xA;that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in&#xA;these notices.&#xA;&#xA;  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for&#xA;that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all&#xA;subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.&#xA;&#xA;  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of&#xA;the Library into a program that is not a library.&#xA;&#xA;  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or&#xA;derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form&#xA;under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany&#xA;it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which&#xA;must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a&#xA;medium customarily used for software interchange.&#xA;&#xA;  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy&#xA;from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the&#xA;source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to&#xA;distribute the source code, even though third parties are not&#xA;compelled to copy the source along with the object code.&#xA;&#xA;  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the&#xA;Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or&#xA;linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;.  Such a&#xA;work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and&#xA;therefore falls outside the scope of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library&#xA;creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it&#xA;contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses the&#xA;library&quot;.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.&#xA;Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.&#xA;&#xA;  When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header file&#xA;that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a&#xA;derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.&#xA;Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be&#xA;linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The&#xA;threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.&#xA;&#xA;  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data&#xA;structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline&#xA;functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object&#xA;file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative&#xA;work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the&#xA;Library will still fall under Section 6.)&#xA;&#xA;  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may&#xA;distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.&#xA;Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,&#xA;whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.&#xA;&#xA;  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or&#xA;link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce a&#xA;work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work&#xA;under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit&#xA;modification of the work for the customer&apos;s own use and reverse&#xA;engineering for debugging such modifications.&#xA;&#xA;  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the&#xA;Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by&#xA;this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work&#xA;during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the&#xA;copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference&#xA;directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one&#xA;of these things:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding&#xA;    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever&#xA;    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under&#xA;    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked&#xA;    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that&#xA;    uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that the&#xA;    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified&#xA;    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood&#xA;    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the&#xA;    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application&#xA;    to use the modified definitions.)&#xA;&#xA;    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the&#xA;    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a&#xA;    copy of the library already present on the user&apos;s computer system,&#xA;    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)&#xA;    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if&#xA;    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is&#xA;    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.&#xA;&#xA;    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at&#xA;    least three years, to give the same user the materials&#xA;    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more&#xA;    than the cost of performing this distribution.&#xA;&#xA;    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy&#xA;    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above&#xA;    specified materials from the same place.&#xA;&#xA;    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these&#xA;    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.&#xA;&#xA;  For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the&#xA;Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for&#xA;reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,&#xA;the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is&#xA;normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major&#xA;components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on&#xA;which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies&#xA;the executable.&#xA;&#xA;  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license&#xA;restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally&#xA;accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot&#xA;use both them and the Library together in an executable that you&#xA;distribute.&#xA;&#xA;  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the&#xA;Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library&#xA;facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined&#xA;library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on&#xA;the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise&#xA;permitted, and provided that you do these two things:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work&#xA;    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library&#xA;    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the&#xA;    Sections above.&#xA;&#xA;    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact&#xA;    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining&#xA;    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.&#xA;&#xA;  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute&#xA;the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any&#xA;attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or&#xA;distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your&#xA;rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,&#xA;or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses&#xA;terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.&#xA;&#xA;  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not&#xA;signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or&#xA;distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are&#xA;prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by&#xA;modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the&#xA;Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and&#xA;all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying&#xA;the Library or works based on it.&#xA;&#xA;  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the&#xA;Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the&#xA;original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library&#xA;subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further&#xA;restrictions on the recipients&apos; exercise of the rights granted herein.&#xA;You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with&#xA;this License.&#xA;&#xA;  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent&#xA;infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),&#xA;conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot&#xA;distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you&#xA;may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent&#xA;license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by&#xA;all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then&#xA;the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to&#xA;refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.&#xA;&#xA;If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any&#xA;particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,&#xA;and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.&#xA;&#xA;It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any&#xA;patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any&#xA;such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the&#xA;integrity of the free software distribution system which is&#xA;implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made&#xA;generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed&#xA;through that system in reliance on consistent application of that&#xA;system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing&#xA;to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot&#xA;impose that choice.&#xA;&#xA;This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to&#xA;be a consequence of the rest of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in&#xA;certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the&#xA;original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add&#xA;an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,&#xA;so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus&#xA;excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if&#xA;written in the body of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new&#xA;versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.&#xA;Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,&#xA;but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.&#xA;&#xA;Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library&#xA;specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and&#xA;&quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and&#xA;conditions either of that version or of any later version published by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a&#xA;license version number, you may choose any version ever published by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation.&#xA;&#xA;  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free&#xA;programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,&#xA;write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is&#xA;copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free&#xA;Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our&#xA;decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status&#xA;of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing&#xA;and reuse of software generally.&#xA;&#xA;       NO WARRANTY&#xA;&#xA;  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO&#xA;WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.&#xA;EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR&#xA;OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY&#xA;KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE&#xA;IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#xA;PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE&#xA;LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME&#xA;THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;&#xA;  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN&#xA;WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY&#xA;AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU&#xA;FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR&#xA;CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE&#xA;LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING&#xA;RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A&#xA;FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF&#xA;SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH&#xA;DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;       END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;&#xA;           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries&#xA;&#xA;  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest&#xA;possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that&#xA;everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting&#xA;redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the&#xA;ordinary General Public License).&#xA;&#xA;  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is&#xA;safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively&#xA;convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the&#xA;&quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.&#xA;&#xA;    &lt;one line to give the library&apos;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;&#xA;    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;&#xA;&#xA;    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or&#xA;    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either&#xA;    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.&#xA;&#xA;    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,&#xA;    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of&#xA;    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU&#xA;    Lesser General Public License for more details.&#xA;&#xA;    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software&#xA;    Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA&#xA;&#xA;Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.&#xA;&#xA;You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your&#xA;school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the library, if&#xA;necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:&#xA;&#xA;  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the&#xA;  library `Frob&apos; (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.&#xA;&#xA;  &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1990&#xA;  Ty Coon, President of Vice&#xA;&#xA;That&apos;s all there is to it!

          GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;Version 2.1, February 1999&#xA;Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.&#xA;59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA&#xA;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies&#xA;of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.&#xA;[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also&#xA;counts&#xA;as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2,&#xA;hence&#xA;the version number 2.1.]&#xA;Preamble&#xA;The licenses for most software are designed to take away your&#xA;freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General&#xA;Public&#xA;Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and&#xA;change&#xA;free software--to make sure the software is free for all its&#xA;users.&#xA;This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some&#xA;specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of&#xA;the&#xA;Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use&#xA;it.  You&#xA;can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about&#xA;whether&#xA;this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better&#xA;strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations&#xA;below.&#xA;When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of&#xA;use,&#xA;not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make&#xA;sure that&#xA;you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and&#xA;charge&#xA;for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or&#xA;can get&#xA;it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces&#xA;of&#xA;it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can&#xA;do&#xA;these things.&#xA;To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid&#xA;distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender&#xA;these&#xA;rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities&#xA;for&#xA;you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify&#xA;it.&#xA;For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether&#xA;gratis&#xA;or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that&#xA;we gave&#xA;you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the&#xA;source&#xA;code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide&#xA;complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink&#xA;them&#xA;with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling&#xA;it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.&#xA;We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright&#xA;the&#xA;library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal&#xA;permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.&#xA;To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that&#xA;there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library&#xA;is&#xA;modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should&#xA;know&#xA;that what they have is not the original version, so that the&#xA;original&#xA;author&apos;s reputation will not be affected by problems that might&#xA;be&#xA;introduced by others.&#xA;Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence&#xA;of&#xA;any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot&#xA;effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining&#xA;a&#xA;restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist&#xA;that&#xA;any patent license obtained for a version of the library must&#xA;be&#xA;consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.&#xA;Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the&#xA;ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser&#xA;General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries,&#xA;and&#xA;is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.&#xA;We use&#xA;this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking&#xA;those&#xA;libraries into non-free programs.&#xA;When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or&#xA;using&#xA;a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking&#xA;a&#xA;combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary&#xA;General Public License therefore permits such linking only if&#xA;the&#xA;entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser&#xA;General&#xA;Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code&#xA;with&#xA;the library.&#xA;We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because&#xA;it&#xA;does Less to protect the user&apos;s freedom than the ordinary General&#xA;Public License.  It also provides other free software developers&#xA;Less&#xA;of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages&#xA;are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for&#xA;many&#xA;libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in&#xA;certain&#xA;special circumstances.&#xA;For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to&#xA;encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that&#xA;it becomes&#xA;a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must&#xA;be&#xA;allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free&#xA;library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.&#xA;In this&#xA;case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to&#xA;free&#xA;software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.&#xA;In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free&#xA;programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body&#xA;of&#xA;free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library&#xA;in&#xA;non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU&#xA;operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating&#xA;system.&#xA;Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective&#xA;of the&#xA;users&apos; freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that&#xA;is&#xA;linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to&#xA;run&#xA;that program using a modified version of the Library.&#xA;The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between&#xA;a&#xA;&quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;.&#xA;The&#xA;former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter&#xA;must&#xA;be combined with the library in order to run.&#xA;GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION&#xA;0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or&#xA;other&#xA;program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder&#xA;or&#xA;other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the&#xA;terms of&#xA;this Lesser General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;).&#xA;Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.&#xA;A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data&#xA;prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs&#xA;(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.&#xA;The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or&#xA;work&#xA;which has been distributed under these terms.  A &quot;work based&#xA;on the&#xA;Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under&#xA;copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library&#xA;or a&#xA;portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated&#xA;straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation&#xA;is&#xA;included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)&#xA;&quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work&#xA;for&#xA;making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code&#xA;means&#xA;all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated&#xA;interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control&#xA;compilation&#xA;and installation of the library.&#xA;Activities other than copying, distribution and modification&#xA;are not&#xA;covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act&#xA;of&#xA;running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output&#xA;from&#xA;such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work&#xA;based&#xA;on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool&#xA;for&#xA;writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library&#xA;does&#xA;and what the program that uses the Library does.&#xA;1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library&apos;s&#xA;complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided&#xA;that&#xA;you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an&#xA;appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep&#xA;intact&#xA;all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence&#xA;of any&#xA;warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the&#xA;Library.&#xA;You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,&#xA;and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange&#xA;for a&#xA;fee.&#xA;2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion&#xA;of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and&#xA;distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section&#xA;1&#xA;above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;a) The modified work must itself be a software library.&#xA;b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices&#xA;stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.&#xA;c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no&#xA;charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.&#xA;d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function&#xA;or a&#xA;table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses&#xA;the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility&#xA;is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure&#xA;that,&#xA;in the event an application does not supply such function or&#xA;table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part&#xA;of&#xA;its purpose remains meaningful.&#xA;(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots&#xA;has&#xA;a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the&#xA;application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any&#xA;application-supplied function or table used by this function&#xA;must&#xA;be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square&#xA;root function must still compute square roots.)&#xA;These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If&#xA;identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,&#xA;and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works&#xA;in&#xA;themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to&#xA;those&#xA;sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when&#xA;you&#xA;distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work&#xA;based&#xA;on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the&#xA;terms of&#xA;this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to&#xA;the&#xA;entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who&#xA;wrote&#xA;it.&#xA;Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or&#xA;contest&#xA;your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent&#xA;is to&#xA;exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative&#xA;or&#xA;collective works based on the Library.&#xA;In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the&#xA;Library&#xA;with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume&#xA;of&#xA;a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work&#xA;under&#xA;the scope of this License.&#xA;3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General&#xA;Public&#xA;License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.&#xA;To do&#xA;this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License,&#xA;so&#xA;that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version&#xA;2,&#xA;instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version&#xA;2 of the&#xA;ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can&#xA;specify&#xA;that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change&#xA;in&#xA;these notices.&#xA;Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible&#xA;for&#xA;that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies&#xA;to all&#xA;subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.&#xA;This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code&#xA;of&#xA;the Library into a program that is not a library.&#xA;4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or&#xA;derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable&#xA;form&#xA;under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany&#xA;it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code,&#xA;which&#xA;must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above&#xA;on a&#xA;medium customarily used for software interchange.&#xA;If distribution of object code is made by offering access to&#xA;copy&#xA;from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy&#xA;the&#xA;source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to&#xA;distribute the source code, even though third parties are not&#xA;compelled to copy the source along with the object code.&#xA;5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the&#xA;Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled&#xA;or&#xA;linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;.  Such&#xA;a&#xA;work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library,&#xA;and&#xA;therefore falls outside the scope of this License.&#xA;However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library&#xA;creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because&#xA;it&#xA;contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses&#xA;the&#xA;library&quot;.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.&#xA;Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.&#xA;When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header&#xA;file&#xA;that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may&#xA;be a&#xA;derivative work of the Library even though the source code is&#xA;not.&#xA;Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can&#xA;be&#xA;linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.&#xA;The&#xA;threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.&#xA;If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data&#xA;structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline&#xA;functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the&#xA;object&#xA;file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative&#xA;work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions&#xA;of the&#xA;Library will still fall under Section 6.)&#xA;Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may&#xA;distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section&#xA;6.&#xA;Any executables containing that work also fall under Section&#xA;6,&#xA;whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.&#xA;6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine&#xA;or&#xA;link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce&#xA;a&#xA;work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that&#xA;work&#xA;under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit&#xA;modification of the work for the customer&apos;s own use and reverse&#xA;engineering for debugging such modifications.&#xA;You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that&#xA;the&#xA;Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered&#xA;by&#xA;this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the&#xA;work&#xA;during execution displays copyright notices, you must include&#xA;the&#xA;copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference&#xA;directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must&#xA;do one&#xA;of these things:&#xA;a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding&#xA;machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever&#xA;changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under&#xA;Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked&#xA;with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that&#xA;uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that&#xA;the&#xA;user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified&#xA;executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood&#xA;that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in&#xA;the&#xA;Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application&#xA;to use the modified definitions.)&#xA;b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the&#xA;Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time&#xA;a&#xA;copy of the library already present on the user&apos;s computer system,&#xA;rather than copying library functions into the executable, and&#xA;(2)&#xA;will operate properly with a modified version of the library,&#xA;if&#xA;the user installs one, as long as the modified version is&#xA;interface-compatible with the version that the work was made&#xA;with.&#xA;c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at&#xA;least three years, to give the same user the materials&#xA;specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more&#xA;than the cost of performing this distribution.&#xA;d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to&#xA;copy&#xA;from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the&#xA;above&#xA;specified materials from the same place.&#xA;e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these&#xA;materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.&#xA;For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the&#xA;Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for&#xA;reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,&#xA;the materials to be distributed need not include anything that&#xA;is&#xA;normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the&#xA;major&#xA;components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system&#xA;on&#xA;which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies&#xA;the executable.&#xA;It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license&#xA;restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally&#xA;accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you&#xA;cannot&#xA;use both them and the Library together in an executable that&#xA;you&#xA;distribute.&#xA;7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on&#xA;the&#xA;Library side-by-side in a single library together with other&#xA;library&#xA;facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a&#xA;combined&#xA;library, provided that the separate distribution of the work&#xA;based on&#xA;the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise&#xA;permitted, and provided that you do these two things:&#xA;a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work&#xA;based on the Library, uncombined with any other library&#xA;facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the&#xA;Sections above.&#xA;b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact&#xA;that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining&#xA;where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.&#xA;8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute&#xA;the Library except as expressly provided under this License.&#xA;Any&#xA;attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or&#xA;distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate&#xA;your&#xA;rights under this License.  However, parties who have received&#xA;copies,&#xA;or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses&#xA;terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.&#xA;9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have&#xA;not&#xA;signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify&#xA;or&#xA;distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions&#xA;are&#xA;prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore,&#xA;by&#xA;modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the&#xA;Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do&#xA;so, and&#xA;all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying&#xA;the Library or works based on it.&#xA;10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based&#xA;on the&#xA;Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from&#xA;the&#xA;original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the&#xA;Library&#xA;subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any&#xA;further&#xA;restrictions on the recipients&apos; exercise of the rights granted&#xA;herein.&#xA;You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties&#xA;with&#xA;this License.&#xA;11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of&#xA;patent&#xA;infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),&#xA;conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement&#xA;or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they&#xA;do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot&#xA;distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under&#xA;this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence&#xA;you&#xA;may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent&#xA;license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library&#xA;by&#xA;all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you,&#xA;then&#xA;the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would&#xA;be to&#xA;refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.&#xA;If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable&#xA;under any&#xA;particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended&#xA;to apply,&#xA;and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.&#xA;It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe&#xA;any&#xA;patents or other property right claims or to contest validity&#xA;of any&#xA;such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting&#xA;the&#xA;integrity of the free software distribution system which is&#xA;implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made&#xA;generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed&#xA;through that system in reliance on consistent application of&#xA;that&#xA;system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is&#xA;willing&#xA;to distribute software through any other system and a licensee&#xA;cannot&#xA;impose that choice.&#xA;This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed&#xA;to&#xA;be a consequence of the rest of this License.&#xA;12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted&#xA;in&#xA;certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,&#xA;the&#xA;original copyright holder who places the Library under this License&#xA;may add&#xA;an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those&#xA;countries,&#xA;so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries&#xA;not thus&#xA;excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation&#xA;as if&#xA;written in the body of this License.&#xA;13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new&#xA;versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.&#xA;Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,&#xA;but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.&#xA;Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&#xA;Library&#xA;specifies a version number of this License which applies to it&#xA;and&#xA;&quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms&#xA;and&#xA;conditions either of that version or of any later version published&#xA;by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify&#xA;a&#xA;license version number, you may choose any version ever published&#xA;by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation.&#xA;14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other&#xA;free&#xA;programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with&#xA;these,&#xA;write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which&#xA;is&#xA;copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free&#xA;Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. &#xA;Our&#xA;decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free&#xA;status&#xA;of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the&#xA;sharing&#xA;and reuse of software generally.&#xA;NO WARRANTY&#xA;15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS&#xA;NO&#xA;WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE&#xA;LAW.&#xA;EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS&#xA;AND/OR&#xA;OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF&#xA;ANY&#xA;KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED&#xA;TO, THE&#xA;IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#xA;PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF&#xA;THE&#xA;LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU&#xA;ASSUME&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO&#xA;IN&#xA;WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY&#xA;MODIFY&#xA;AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE&#xA;TO YOU&#xA;FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR&#xA;CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO&#xA;USE THE&#xA;LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING&#xA;RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES&#xA;OR A&#xA;FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN&#xA;IF&#xA;SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY&#xA;OF SUCH&#xA;DAMAGES.&#xA;END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries&#xA;If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest&#xA;possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software&#xA;that&#xA;everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting&#xA;redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the&#xA;terms of the&#xA;ordinary General Public License).&#xA;To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.&#xA;It is&#xA;safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most&#xA;effectively&#xA;convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at&#xA;least the&#xA;&quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.&#xA;&lt;one line to give the library&apos;s name and a brief idea of what&#xA;it does.&gt;&#xA;Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;&#xA;This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or&#xA;modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either&#xA;version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.&#xA;This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,&#xA;but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of&#xA;MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the&#xA;GNU&#xA;Lesser General Public License for more details.&#xA;You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software&#xA;Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307&#xA;USA&#xA;Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and&#xA;paper mail.&#xA;You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer)&#xA;or your&#xA;school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the library,&#xA;if&#xA;necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:&#xA;Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the&#xA;library `Frob&apos; (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James&#xA;Random Hacker.&#xA;&lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1990&#xA;Ty Coon, President of Vice&#xA;That&apos;s all there is to it!

          GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;         Version 2.1, February 1999&#xA;&#xA; Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.&#xA;     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA&#xA; Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies&#xA; of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.&#xA;&#xA;[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts&#xA; as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence&#xA; the version number 2.1.]&#xA;&#xA;       Preamble&#xA;&#xA;  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your&#xA;freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public&#xA;Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change&#xA;free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.&#xA;&#xA;  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some&#xA;specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the&#xA;Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You&#xA;can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether&#xA;this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better&#xA;strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.&#xA;&#xA;  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,&#xA;not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that&#xA;you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge&#xA;for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get&#xA;it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of&#xA;it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do&#xA;these things.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid&#xA;distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these&#xA;rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for&#xA;you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis&#xA;or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave&#xA;you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source&#xA;code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide&#xA;complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them&#xA;with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling&#xA;it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.&#xA;&#xA;  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the&#xA;library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal&#xA;permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that&#xA;there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is&#xA;modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know&#xA;that what they have is not the original version, so that the original&#xA;author&apos;s reputation will not be affected by problems that might be&#xA;introduced by others.&#xA;&#xA;  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of&#xA;any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot&#xA;effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a&#xA;restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that&#xA;any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be&#xA;consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.&#xA;&#xA;  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the&#xA;ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser&#xA;General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and&#xA;is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use&#xA;this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those&#xA;libraries into non-free programs.&#xA;&#xA;  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using&#xA;a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a&#xA;combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary&#xA;General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the&#xA;entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General&#xA;Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with&#xA;the library.&#xA;&#xA;  We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because it&#xA;does Less to protect the user&apos;s freedom than the ordinary General&#xA;Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less&#xA;of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages&#xA;are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many&#xA;libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain&#xA;special circumstances.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to&#xA;encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes&#xA;a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be&#xA;allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free&#xA;library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this&#xA;case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free&#xA;software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free&#xA;programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of&#xA;free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in&#xA;non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU&#xA;operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating&#xA;system.&#xA;&#xA;  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the&#xA;users&apos; freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is&#xA;linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run&#xA;that program using a modified version of the Library.&#xA;&#xA;  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a&#xA;&quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;.  The&#xA;former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must&#xA;be combined with the library in order to run.&#xA;&#xA;    GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION&#xA;&#xA;  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other&#xA;program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or&#xA;other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of&#xA;this Lesser General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;).&#xA;Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data&#xA;prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs&#xA;(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work&#xA;which has been distributed under these terms.  A &quot;work based on the&#xA;Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under&#xA;copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a&#xA;portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated&#xA;straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is&#xA;included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for&#xA;making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means&#xA;all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated&#xA;interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation&#xA;and installation of the library.&#xA;&#xA;  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not&#xA;covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of&#xA;running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from&#xA;such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based&#xA;on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for&#xA;writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does&#xA;and what the program that uses the Library does.&#xA;  &#xA;  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library&apos;s&#xA;complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that&#xA;you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an&#xA;appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact&#xA;all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any&#xA;warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the&#xA;Library.&#xA;&#xA;  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,&#xA;and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a&#xA;fee.&#xA;&#xA;  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion&#xA;of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and&#xA;distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1&#xA;above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;&#xA;    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.&#xA;&#xA;    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices&#xA;    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.&#xA;&#xA;    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no&#xA;    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.&#xA;&#xA;    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a&#xA;    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses&#xA;    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility&#xA;    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,&#xA;    in the event an application does not supply such function or&#xA;    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of&#xA;    its purpose remains meaningful.&#xA;&#xA;    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has&#xA;    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the&#xA;    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any&#xA;    application-supplied function or table used by this function must&#xA;    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square&#xA;    root function must still compute square roots.)&#xA;&#xA;These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If&#xA;identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,&#xA;and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in&#xA;themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those&#xA;sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you&#xA;distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based&#xA;on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of&#xA;this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the&#xA;entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote&#xA;it.&#xA;&#xA;Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest&#xA;your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to&#xA;exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or&#xA;collective works based on the Library.&#xA;&#xA;In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library&#xA;with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of&#xA;a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under&#xA;the scope of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public&#xA;License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do&#xA;this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so&#xA;that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,&#xA;instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the&#xA;ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify&#xA;that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in&#xA;these notices.&#xA;&#xA;  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for&#xA;that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all&#xA;subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.&#xA;&#xA;  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of&#xA;the Library into a program that is not a library.&#xA;&#xA;  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or&#xA;derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form&#xA;under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany&#xA;it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which&#xA;must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a&#xA;medium customarily used for software interchange.&#xA;&#xA;  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy&#xA;from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the&#xA;source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to&#xA;distribute the source code, even though third parties are not&#xA;compelled to copy the source along with the object code.&#xA;&#xA;  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the&#xA;Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or&#xA;linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;.  Such a&#xA;work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and&#xA;therefore falls outside the scope of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library&#xA;creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it&#xA;contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses the&#xA;library&quot;.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.&#xA;Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.&#xA;&#xA;  When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header file&#xA;that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a&#xA;derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.&#xA;Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be&#xA;linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The&#xA;threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.&#xA;&#xA;  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data&#xA;structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline&#xA;functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object&#xA;file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative&#xA;work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the&#xA;Library will still fall under Section 6.)&#xA;&#xA;  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may&#xA;distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.&#xA;Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,&#xA;whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.&#xA;&#xA;  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or&#xA;link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce a&#xA;work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work&#xA;under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit&#xA;modification of the work for the customer&apos;s own use and reverse&#xA;engineering for debugging such modifications.&#xA;&#xA;  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the&#xA;Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by&#xA;this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work&#xA;during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the&#xA;copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference&#xA;directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one&#xA;of these things:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding&#xA;    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever&#xA;    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under&#xA;    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked&#xA;    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that&#xA;    uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that the&#xA;    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified&#xA;    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood&#xA;    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the&#xA;    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application&#xA;    to use the modified definitions.)&#xA;&#xA;    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the&#xA;    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a&#xA;    copy of the library already present on the user&apos;s computer system,&#xA;    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)&#xA;    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if&#xA;    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is&#xA;    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.&#xA;&#xA;    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at&#xA;    least three years, to give the same user the materials&#xA;    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more&#xA;    than the cost of performing this distribution.&#xA;&#xA;    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy&#xA;    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above&#xA;    specified materials from the same place.&#xA;&#xA;    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these&#xA;    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.&#xA;&#xA;  For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the&#xA;Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for&#xA;reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,&#xA;the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is&#xA;normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major&#xA;components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on&#xA;which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies&#xA;the executable.&#xA;&#xA;  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license&#xA;restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally&#xA;accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot&#xA;use both them and the Library together in an executable that you&#xA;distribute.&#xA;&#xA;  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the&#xA;Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library&#xA;facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined&#xA;library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on&#xA;the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise&#xA;permitted, and provided that you do these two things:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work&#xA;    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library&#xA;    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the&#xA;    Sections above.&#xA;&#xA;    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact&#xA;    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining&#xA;    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.&#xA;&#xA;  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute&#xA;the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any&#xA;attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or&#xA;distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your&#xA;rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,&#xA;or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses&#xA;terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.&#xA;&#xA;  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not&#xA;signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or&#xA;distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are&#xA;prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by&#xA;modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the&#xA;Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and&#xA;all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying&#xA;the Library or works based on it.&#xA;&#xA;  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the&#xA;Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the&#xA;original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library&#xA;subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further&#xA;restrictions on the recipients&apos; exercise of the rights granted herein.&#xA;You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with&#xA;this License.&#xA;&#xA;  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent&#xA;infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),&#xA;conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot&#xA;distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you&#xA;may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent&#xA;license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by&#xA;all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then&#xA;the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to&#xA;refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.&#xA;&#xA;If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any&#xA;particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,&#xA;and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.&#xA;&#xA;It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any&#xA;patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any&#xA;such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the&#xA;integrity of the free software distribution system which is&#xA;implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made&#xA;generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed&#xA;through that system in reliance on consistent application of that&#xA;system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing&#xA;to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot&#xA;impose that choice.&#xA;&#xA;This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to&#xA;be a consequence of the rest of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in&#xA;certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the&#xA;original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add&#xA;an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,&#xA;so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus&#xA;excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if&#xA;written in the body of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new&#xA;versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.&#xA;Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,&#xA;but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.&#xA;&#xA;Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library&#xA;specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and&#xA;&quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and&#xA;conditions either of that version or of any later version published by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a&#xA;license version number, you may choose any version ever published by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation.&#xA;&#xA;  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free&#xA;programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,&#xA;write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is&#xA;copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free&#xA;Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our&#xA;decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status&#xA;of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing&#xA;and reuse of software generally.&#xA;&#xA;       NO WARRANTY&#xA;&#xA;  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO&#xA;WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.&#xA;EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR&#xA;OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY&#xA;KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE&#xA;IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#xA;PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE&#xA;LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME&#xA;THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;&#xA;  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN&#xA;WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY&#xA;AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU&#xA;FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR&#xA;CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE&#xA;LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING&#xA;RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A&#xA;FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF&#xA;SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH&#xA;DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;       END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;&#xA;           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries&#xA;&#xA;  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest&#xA;possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that&#xA;everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting&#xA;redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the&#xA;ordinary General Public License).&#xA;&#xA;  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is&#xA;safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively&#xA;convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the&#xA;&quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.&#xA;&#xA;    &lt;one line to give the library&apos;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;&#xA;    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;&#xA;&#xA;    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or&#xA;    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either&#xA;    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.&#xA;&#xA;    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,&#xA;    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of&#xA;    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU&#xA;    Lesser General Public License for more details.&#xA;&#xA;    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software&#xA;    Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA&#xA;&#xA;Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.&#xA;&#xA;You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your&#xA;school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the library, if&#xA;necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:&#xA;&#xA;  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the&#xA;  library `Frob&apos; (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.&#xA;&#xA;  &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1990&#xA;  Ty Coon, President of Vice&#xA;&#xA;That&apos;s all there is to it!

          GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;         Version 2.1, February 1999&#xA;&#xA; Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.&#xA;     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA&#xA; Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies&#xA; of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.&#xA;&#xA;[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts&#xA; as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence&#xA; the version number 2.1.]&#xA;&#xA;       Preamble&#xA;&#xA;  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your&#xA;freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public&#xA;Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change&#xA;free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.&#xA;&#xA;  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some&#xA;specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the&#xA;Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You&#xA;can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether&#xA;this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better&#xA;strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.&#xA;&#xA;  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,&#xA;not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that&#xA;you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge&#xA;for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get&#xA;it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of&#xA;it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do&#xA;these things.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid&#xA;distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these&#xA;rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for&#xA;you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis&#xA;or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave&#xA;you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source&#xA;code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide&#xA;complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them&#xA;with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling&#xA;it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.&#xA;&#xA;  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the&#xA;library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal&#xA;permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that&#xA;there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is&#xA;modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know&#xA;that what they have is not the original version, so that the original&#xA;author&apos;s reputation will not be affected by problems that might be&#xA;introduced by others.&#xA;&#xA;  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of&#xA;any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot&#xA;effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a&#xA;restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that&#xA;any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be&#xA;consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.&#xA;&#xA;  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the&#xA;ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser&#xA;General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and&#xA;is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use&#xA;this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those&#xA;libraries into non-free programs.&#xA;&#xA;  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using&#xA;a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a&#xA;combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary&#xA;General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the&#xA;entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General&#xA;Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with&#xA;the library.&#xA;&#xA;  We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because it&#xA;does Less to protect the user&apos;s freedom than the ordinary General&#xA;Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less&#xA;of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages&#xA;are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many&#xA;libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain&#xA;special circumstances.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to&#xA;encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes&#xA;a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be&#xA;allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free&#xA;library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this&#xA;case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free&#xA;software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free&#xA;programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of&#xA;free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in&#xA;non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU&#xA;operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating&#xA;system.&#xA;&#xA;  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the&#xA;users&apos; freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is&#xA;linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run&#xA;that program using a modified version of the Library.&#xA;&#xA;  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a&#xA;&quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;.  The&#xA;former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must&#xA;be combined with the library in order to run.&#xA;&#xA;    GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION&#xA;&#xA;  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other&#xA;program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or&#xA;other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of&#xA;this Lesser General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;).&#xA;Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data&#xA;prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs&#xA;(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work&#xA;which has been distributed under these terms.  A &quot;work based on the&#xA;Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under&#xA;copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a&#xA;portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated&#xA;straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is&#xA;included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for&#xA;making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means&#xA;all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated&#xA;interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation&#xA;and installation of the library.&#xA;&#xA;  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not&#xA;covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of&#xA;running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from&#xA;such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based&#xA;on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for&#xA;writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does&#xA;and what the program that uses the Library does.&#xA;  &#xA;  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library&apos;s&#xA;complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that&#xA;you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an&#xA;appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact&#xA;all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any&#xA;warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the&#xA;Library.&#xA;&#xA;  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,&#xA;and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a&#xA;fee.&#xA;&#xA;  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion&#xA;of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and&#xA;distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1&#xA;above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;&#xA;    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.&#xA;&#xA;    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices&#xA;    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.&#xA;&#xA;    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no&#xA;    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.&#xA;&#xA;    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a&#xA;    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses&#xA;    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility&#xA;    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,&#xA;    in the event an application does not supply such function or&#xA;    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of&#xA;    its purpose remains meaningful.&#xA;&#xA;    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has&#xA;    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the&#xA;    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any&#xA;    application-supplied function or table used by this function must&#xA;    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square&#xA;    root function must still compute square roots.)&#xA;&#xA;These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If&#xA;identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,&#xA;and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in&#xA;themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those&#xA;sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you&#xA;distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based&#xA;on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of&#xA;this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the&#xA;entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote&#xA;it.&#xA;&#xA;Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest&#xA;your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to&#xA;exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or&#xA;collective works based on the Library.&#xA;&#xA;In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library&#xA;with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of&#xA;a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under&#xA;the scope of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public&#xA;License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do&#xA;this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so&#xA;that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,&#xA;instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the&#xA;ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify&#xA;that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in&#xA;these notices.&#xA;&#xA;  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for&#xA;that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all&#xA;subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.&#xA;&#xA;  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of&#xA;the Library into a program that is not a library.&#xA;&#xA;  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or&#xA;derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form&#xA;under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany&#xA;it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which&#xA;must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a&#xA;medium customarily used for software interchange.&#xA;&#xA;  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy&#xA;from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the&#xA;source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to&#xA;distribute the source code, even though third parties are not&#xA;compelled to copy the source along with the object code.&#xA;&#xA;  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the&#xA;Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or&#xA;linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;.  Such a&#xA;work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and&#xA;therefore falls outside the scope of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library&#xA;creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it&#xA;contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses the&#xA;library&quot;.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.&#xA;Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.&#xA;&#xA;  When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header file&#xA;that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a&#xA;derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.&#xA;Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be&#xA;linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The&#xA;threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.&#xA;&#xA;  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data&#xA;structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline&#xA;functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object&#xA;file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative&#xA;work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the&#xA;Library will still fall under Section 6.)&#xA;&#xA;  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may&#xA;distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.&#xA;Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,&#xA;whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.&#xA;&#xA;  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or&#xA;link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce a&#xA;work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work&#xA;under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit&#xA;modification of the work for the customer&apos;s own use and reverse&#xA;engineering for debugging such modifications.&#xA;&#xA;  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the&#xA;Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by&#xA;this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work&#xA;during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the&#xA;copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference&#xA;directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one&#xA;of these things:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding&#xA;    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever&#xA;    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under&#xA;    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked&#xA;    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that&#xA;    uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that the&#xA;    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified&#xA;    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood&#xA;    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the&#xA;    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application&#xA;    to use the modified definitions.)&#xA;&#xA;    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the&#xA;    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a&#xA;    copy of the library already present on the user&apos;s computer system,&#xA;    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)&#xA;    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if&#xA;    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is&#xA;    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.&#xA;&#xA;    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at&#xA;    least three years, to give the same user the materials&#xA;    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more&#xA;    than the cost of performing this distribution.&#xA;&#xA;    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy&#xA;    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above&#xA;    specified materials from the same place.&#xA;&#xA;    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these&#xA;    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.&#xA;&#xA;  For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the&#xA;Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for&#xA;reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,&#xA;the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is&#xA;normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major&#xA;components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on&#xA;which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies&#xA;the executable.&#xA;&#xA;  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license&#xA;restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally&#xA;accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot&#xA;use both them and the Library together in an executable that you&#xA;distribute.&#xA;&#xA;  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the&#xA;Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library&#xA;facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined&#xA;library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on&#xA;the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise&#xA;permitted, and provided that you do these two things:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work&#xA;    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library&#xA;    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the&#xA;    Sections above.&#xA;&#xA;    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact&#xA;    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining&#xA;    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.&#xA;&#xA;  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute&#xA;the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any&#xA;attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or&#xA;distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your&#xA;rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,&#xA;or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses&#xA;terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.&#xA;&#xA;  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not&#xA;signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or&#xA;distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are&#xA;prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by&#xA;modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the&#xA;Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and&#xA;all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying&#xA;the Library or works based on it.&#xA;&#xA;  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the&#xA;Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the&#xA;original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library&#xA;subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further&#xA;restrictions on the recipients&apos; exercise of the rights granted herein.&#xA;You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with&#xA;this License.&#xA;&#xA;  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent&#xA;infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),&#xA;conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot&#xA;distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you&#xA;may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent&#xA;license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by&#xA;all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then&#xA;the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to&#xA;refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.&#xA;&#xA;If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any&#xA;particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,&#xA;and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.&#xA;&#xA;It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any&#xA;patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any&#xA;such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the&#xA;integrity of the free software distribution system which is&#xA;implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made&#xA;generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed&#xA;through that system in reliance on consistent application of that&#xA;system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing&#xA;to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot&#xA;impose that choice.&#xA;&#xA;This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to&#xA;be a consequence of the rest of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in&#xA;certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the&#xA;original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add&#xA;an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,&#xA;so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus&#xA;excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if&#xA;written in the body of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new&#xA;versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.&#xA;Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,&#xA;but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.&#xA;&#xA;Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library&#xA;specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and&#xA;&quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and&#xA;conditions either of that version or of any later version published by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a&#xA;license version number, you may choose any version ever published by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation.&#xA;&#xA;  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free&#xA;programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,&#xA;write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is&#xA;copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free&#xA;Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our&#xA;decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status&#xA;of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing&#xA;and reuse of software generally.&#xA;&#xA;       NO WARRANTY&#xA;&#xA;  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO&#xA;WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.&#xA;EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR&#xA;OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY&#xA;KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE&#xA;IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#xA;PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE&#xA;LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME&#xA;THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;&#xA;  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN&#xA;WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY&#xA;AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU&#xA;FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR&#xA;CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE&#xA;LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING&#xA;RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A&#xA;FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF&#xA;SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH&#xA;DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;       END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;&#xA;           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries&#xA;&#xA;  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest&#xA;possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that&#xA;everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting&#xA;redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the&#xA;ordinary General Public License).&#xA;&#xA;  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is&#xA;safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively&#xA;convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the&#xA;&quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.&#xA;&#xA;    &lt;one line to give the library&apos;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;&#xA;    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;&#xA;&#xA;    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or&#xA;    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either&#xA;    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.&#xA;&#xA;    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,&#xA;    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of&#xA;    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU&#xA;    Lesser General Public License for more details.&#xA;&#xA;    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software&#xA;    Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA&#xA;&#xA;Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.&#xA;&#xA;You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your&#xA;school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the library, if&#xA;necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:&#xA;&#xA;  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the&#xA;  library `Frob&apos; (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.&#xA;&#xA;  &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1990&#xA;  Ty Coon, President of Vice&#xA;&#xA;That&apos;s all there is to it!

          GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;Version 2.1, February 1999&#xA;Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.&#xA;59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA&#xA;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies&#xA;of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.&#xA;[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also&#xA;counts&#xA;as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2,&#xA;hence&#xA;the version number 2.1.]&#xA;Preamble&#xA;The licenses for most software are designed to take away your&#xA;freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General&#xA;Public&#xA;Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and&#xA;change&#xA;free software--to make sure the software is free for all its&#xA;users.&#xA;This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some&#xA;specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of&#xA;the&#xA;Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use&#xA;it.  You&#xA;can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about&#xA;whether&#xA;this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better&#xA;strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations&#xA;below.&#xA;When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of&#xA;use,&#xA;not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make&#xA;sure that&#xA;you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and&#xA;charge&#xA;for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or&#xA;can get&#xA;it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces&#xA;of&#xA;it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can&#xA;do&#xA;these things.&#xA;To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid&#xA;distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender&#xA;these&#xA;rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities&#xA;for&#xA;you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify&#xA;it.&#xA;For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether&#xA;gratis&#xA;or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that&#xA;we gave&#xA;you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the&#xA;source&#xA;code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide&#xA;complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink&#xA;them&#xA;with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling&#xA;it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.&#xA;We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright&#xA;the&#xA;library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal&#xA;permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.&#xA;To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that&#xA;there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library&#xA;is&#xA;modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should&#xA;know&#xA;that what they have is not the original version, so that the&#xA;original&#xA;author&apos;s reputation will not be affected by problems that might&#xA;be&#xA;introduced by others.&#xA;Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence&#xA;of&#xA;any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot&#xA;effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining&#xA;a&#xA;restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist&#xA;that&#xA;any patent license obtained for a version of the library must&#xA;be&#xA;consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.&#xA;Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the&#xA;ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser&#xA;General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries,&#xA;and&#xA;is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.&#xA;We use&#xA;this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking&#xA;those&#xA;libraries into non-free programs.&#xA;When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or&#xA;using&#xA;a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking&#xA;a&#xA;combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary&#xA;General Public License therefore permits such linking only if&#xA;the&#xA;entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser&#xA;General&#xA;Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code&#xA;with&#xA;the library.&#xA;We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because&#xA;it&#xA;does Less to protect the user&apos;s freedom than the ordinary General&#xA;Public License.  It also provides other free software developers&#xA;Less&#xA;of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages&#xA;are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for&#xA;many&#xA;libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in&#xA;certain&#xA;special circumstances.&#xA;For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to&#xA;encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that&#xA;it becomes&#xA;a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must&#xA;be&#xA;allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free&#xA;library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.&#xA;In this&#xA;case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to&#xA;free&#xA;software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.&#xA;In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free&#xA;programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body&#xA;of&#xA;free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library&#xA;in&#xA;non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU&#xA;operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating&#xA;system.&#xA;Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective&#xA;of the&#xA;users&apos; freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that&#xA;is&#xA;linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to&#xA;run&#xA;that program using a modified version of the Library.&#xA;The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between&#xA;a&#xA;&quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;.&#xA;The&#xA;former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter&#xA;must&#xA;be combined with the library in order to run.&#xA;GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION&#xA;0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or&#xA;other&#xA;program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder&#xA;or&#xA;other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the&#xA;terms of&#xA;this Lesser General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;).&#xA;Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.&#xA;A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data&#xA;prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs&#xA;(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.&#xA;The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or&#xA;work&#xA;which has been distributed under these terms.  A &quot;work based&#xA;on the&#xA;Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under&#xA;copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library&#xA;or a&#xA;portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated&#xA;straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation&#xA;is&#xA;included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)&#xA;&quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work&#xA;for&#xA;making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code&#xA;means&#xA;all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated&#xA;interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control&#xA;compilation&#xA;and installation of the library.&#xA;Activities other than copying, distribution and modification&#xA;are not&#xA;covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act&#xA;of&#xA;running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output&#xA;from&#xA;such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work&#xA;based&#xA;on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool&#xA;for&#xA;writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library&#xA;does&#xA;and what the program that uses the Library does.&#xA;1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library&apos;s&#xA;complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided&#xA;that&#xA;you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an&#xA;appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep&#xA;intact&#xA;all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence&#xA;of any&#xA;warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the&#xA;Library.&#xA;You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,&#xA;and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange&#xA;for a&#xA;fee.&#xA;2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion&#xA;of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and&#xA;distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section&#xA;1&#xA;above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;a) The modified work must itself be a software library.&#xA;b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices&#xA;stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.&#xA;c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no&#xA;charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.&#xA;d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function&#xA;or a&#xA;table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses&#xA;the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility&#xA;is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure&#xA;that,&#xA;in the event an application does not supply such function or&#xA;table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part&#xA;of&#xA;its purpose remains meaningful.&#xA;(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots&#xA;has&#xA;a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the&#xA;application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any&#xA;application-supplied function or table used by this function&#xA;must&#xA;be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square&#xA;root function must still compute square roots.)&#xA;These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If&#xA;identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,&#xA;and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works&#xA;in&#xA;themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to&#xA;those&#xA;sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when&#xA;you&#xA;distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work&#xA;based&#xA;on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the&#xA;terms of&#xA;this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to&#xA;the&#xA;entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who&#xA;wrote&#xA;it.&#xA;Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or&#xA;contest&#xA;your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent&#xA;is to&#xA;exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative&#xA;or&#xA;collective works based on the Library.&#xA;In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the&#xA;Library&#xA;with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume&#xA;of&#xA;a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work&#xA;under&#xA;the scope of this License.&#xA;3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General&#xA;Public&#xA;License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.&#xA;To do&#xA;this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License,&#xA;so&#xA;that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version&#xA;2,&#xA;instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version&#xA;2 of the&#xA;ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can&#xA;specify&#xA;that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change&#xA;in&#xA;these notices.&#xA;Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible&#xA;for&#xA;that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies&#xA;to all&#xA;subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.&#xA;This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code&#xA;of&#xA;the Library into a program that is not a library.&#xA;4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or&#xA;derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable&#xA;form&#xA;under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany&#xA;it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code,&#xA;which&#xA;must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above&#xA;on a&#xA;medium customarily used for software interchange.&#xA;If distribution of object code is made by offering access to&#xA;copy&#xA;from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy&#xA;the&#xA;source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to&#xA;distribute the source code, even though third parties are not&#xA;compelled to copy the source along with the object code.&#xA;5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the&#xA;Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled&#xA;or&#xA;linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;.  Such&#xA;a&#xA;work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library,&#xA;and&#xA;therefore falls outside the scope of this License.&#xA;However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library&#xA;creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because&#xA;it&#xA;contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses&#xA;the&#xA;library&quot;.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.&#xA;Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.&#xA;When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header&#xA;file&#xA;that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may&#xA;be a&#xA;derivative work of the Library even though the source code is&#xA;not.&#xA;Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can&#xA;be&#xA;linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.&#xA;The&#xA;threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.&#xA;If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data&#xA;structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline&#xA;functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the&#xA;object&#xA;file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative&#xA;work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions&#xA;of the&#xA;Library will still fall under Section 6.)&#xA;Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may&#xA;distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section&#xA;6.&#xA;Any executables containing that work also fall under Section&#xA;6,&#xA;whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.&#xA;6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine&#xA;or&#xA;link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce&#xA;a&#xA;work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that&#xA;work&#xA;under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit&#xA;modification of the work for the customer&apos;s own use and reverse&#xA;engineering for debugging such modifications.&#xA;You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that&#xA;the&#xA;Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered&#xA;by&#xA;this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the&#xA;work&#xA;during execution displays copyright notices, you must include&#xA;the&#xA;copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference&#xA;directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must&#xA;do one&#xA;of these things:&#xA;a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding&#xA;machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever&#xA;changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under&#xA;Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked&#xA;with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that&#xA;uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that&#xA;the&#xA;user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified&#xA;executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood&#xA;that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in&#xA;the&#xA;Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application&#xA;to use the modified definitions.)&#xA;b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the&#xA;Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time&#xA;a&#xA;copy of the library already present on the user&apos;s computer system,&#xA;rather than copying library functions into the executable, and&#xA;(2)&#xA;will operate properly with a modified version of the library,&#xA;if&#xA;the user installs one, as long as the modified version is&#xA;interface-compatible with the version that the work was made&#xA;with.&#xA;c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at&#xA;least three years, to give the same user the materials&#xA;specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more&#xA;than the cost of performing this distribution.&#xA;d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to&#xA;copy&#xA;from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the&#xA;above&#xA;specified materials from the same place.&#xA;e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these&#xA;materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.&#xA;For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the&#xA;Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for&#xA;reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,&#xA;the materials to be distributed need not include anything that&#xA;is&#xA;normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the&#xA;major&#xA;components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system&#xA;on&#xA;which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies&#xA;the executable.&#xA;It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license&#xA;restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally&#xA;accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you&#xA;cannot&#xA;use both them and the Library together in an executable that&#xA;you&#xA;distribute.&#xA;7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on&#xA;the&#xA;Library side-by-side in a single library together with other&#xA;library&#xA;facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a&#xA;combined&#xA;library, provided that the separate distribution of the work&#xA;based on&#xA;the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise&#xA;permitted, and provided that you do these two things:&#xA;a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work&#xA;based on the Library, uncombined with any other library&#xA;facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the&#xA;Sections above.&#xA;b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact&#xA;that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining&#xA;where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.&#xA;8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute&#xA;the Library except as expressly provided under this License.&#xA;Any&#xA;attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or&#xA;distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate&#xA;your&#xA;rights under this License.  However, parties who have received&#xA;copies,&#xA;or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses&#xA;terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.&#xA;9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have&#xA;not&#xA;signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify&#xA;or&#xA;distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions&#xA;are&#xA;prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore,&#xA;by&#xA;modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the&#xA;Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do&#xA;so, and&#xA;all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying&#xA;the Library or works based on it.&#xA;10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based&#xA;on the&#xA;Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from&#xA;the&#xA;original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the&#xA;Library&#xA;subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any&#xA;further&#xA;restrictions on the recipients&apos; exercise of the rights granted&#xA;herein.&#xA;You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties&#xA;with&#xA;this License.&#xA;11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of&#xA;patent&#xA;infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),&#xA;conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement&#xA;or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they&#xA;do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot&#xA;distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under&#xA;this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence&#xA;you&#xA;may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent&#xA;license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library&#xA;by&#xA;all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you,&#xA;then&#xA;the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would&#xA;be to&#xA;refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.&#xA;If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable&#xA;under any&#xA;particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended&#xA;to apply,&#xA;and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.&#xA;It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe&#xA;any&#xA;patents or other property right claims or to contest validity&#xA;of any&#xA;such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting&#xA;the&#xA;integrity of the free software distribution system which is&#xA;implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made&#xA;generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed&#xA;through that system in reliance on consistent application of&#xA;that&#xA;system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is&#xA;willing&#xA;to distribute software through any other system and a licensee&#xA;cannot&#xA;impose that choice.&#xA;This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed&#xA;to&#xA;be a consequence of the rest of this License.&#xA;12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted&#xA;in&#xA;certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,&#xA;the&#xA;original copyright holder who places the Library under this License&#xA;may add&#xA;an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those&#xA;countries,&#xA;so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries&#xA;not thus&#xA;excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation&#xA;as if&#xA;written in the body of this License.&#xA;13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new&#xA;versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.&#xA;Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,&#xA;but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.&#xA;Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&#xA;Library&#xA;specifies a version number of this License which applies to it&#xA;and&#xA;&quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms&#xA;and&#xA;conditions either of that version or of any later version published&#xA;by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify&#xA;a&#xA;license version number, you may choose any version ever published&#xA;by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation.&#xA;14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other&#xA;free&#xA;programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with&#xA;these,&#xA;write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which&#xA;is&#xA;copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free&#xA;Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. &#xA;Our&#xA;decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free&#xA;status&#xA;of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the&#xA;sharing&#xA;and reuse of software generally.&#xA;NO WARRANTY&#xA;15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS&#xA;NO&#xA;WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE&#xA;LAW.&#xA;EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS&#xA;AND/OR&#xA;OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF&#xA;ANY&#xA;KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED&#xA;TO, THE&#xA;IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#xA;PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF&#xA;THE&#xA;LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU&#xA;ASSUME&#xA;THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO&#xA;IN&#xA;WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY&#xA;MODIFY&#xA;AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE&#xA;TO YOU&#xA;FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR&#xA;CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO&#xA;USE THE&#xA;LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING&#xA;RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES&#xA;OR A&#xA;FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN&#xA;IF&#xA;SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY&#xA;OF SUCH&#xA;DAMAGES.&#xA;END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries&#xA;If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest&#xA;possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software&#xA;that&#xA;everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting&#xA;redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the&#xA;terms of the&#xA;ordinary General Public License).&#xA;To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.&#xA;It is&#xA;safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most&#xA;effectively&#xA;convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at&#xA;least the&#xA;&quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.&#xA;&lt;one line to give the library&apos;s name and a brief idea of what&#xA;it does.&gt;&#xA;Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;&#xA;This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or&#xA;modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either&#xA;version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.&#xA;This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,&#xA;but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of&#xA;MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the&#xA;GNU&#xA;Lesser General Public License for more details.&#xA;You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software&#xA;Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307&#xA;USA&#xA;Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and&#xA;paper mail.&#xA;You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer)&#xA;or your&#xA;school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the library,&#xA;if&#xA;necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:&#xA;Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the&#xA;library `Frob&apos; (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James&#xA;Random Hacker.&#xA;&lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1990&#xA;Ty Coon, President of Vice&#xA;That&apos;s all there is to it!

          GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;         Version 2.1, February 1999&#xA;&#xA; Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.&#xA;     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA&#xA; Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies&#xA; of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.&#xA;&#xA;[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts&#xA; as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence&#xA; the version number 2.1.]&#xA;&#xA;       Preamble&#xA;&#xA;  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your&#xA;freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public&#xA;Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change&#xA;free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.&#xA;&#xA;  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some&#xA;specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the&#xA;Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You&#xA;can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether&#xA;this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better&#xA;strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.&#xA;&#xA;  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,&#xA;not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that&#xA;you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge&#xA;for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get&#xA;it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of&#xA;it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do&#xA;these things.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid&#xA;distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these&#xA;rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for&#xA;you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis&#xA;or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave&#xA;you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source&#xA;code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide&#xA;complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them&#xA;with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling&#xA;it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.&#xA;&#xA;  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the&#xA;library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal&#xA;permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that&#xA;there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is&#xA;modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know&#xA;that what they have is not the original version, so that the original&#xA;author&apos;s reputation will not be affected by problems that might be&#xA;introduced by others.&#xA;&#xA;  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of&#xA;any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot&#xA;effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a&#xA;restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that&#xA;any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be&#xA;consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.&#xA;&#xA;  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the&#xA;ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser&#xA;General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and&#xA;is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use&#xA;this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those&#xA;libraries into non-free programs.&#xA;&#xA;  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using&#xA;a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a&#xA;combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary&#xA;General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the&#xA;entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General&#xA;Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with&#xA;the library.&#xA;&#xA;  We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because it&#xA;does Less to protect the user&apos;s freedom than the ordinary General&#xA;Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less&#xA;of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages&#xA;are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many&#xA;libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain&#xA;special circumstances.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to&#xA;encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes&#xA;a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be&#xA;allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free&#xA;library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this&#xA;case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free&#xA;software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free&#xA;programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of&#xA;free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in&#xA;non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU&#xA;operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating&#xA;system.&#xA;&#xA;  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the&#xA;users&apos; freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is&#xA;linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run&#xA;that program using a modified version of the Library.&#xA;&#xA;  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a&#xA;&quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;.  The&#xA;former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must&#xA;be combined with the library in order to run.&#xA;&#xA;    GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION&#xA;&#xA;  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other&#xA;program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or&#xA;other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of&#xA;this Lesser General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;).&#xA;Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data&#xA;prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs&#xA;(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work&#xA;which has been distributed under these terms.  A &quot;work based on the&#xA;Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under&#xA;copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a&#xA;portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated&#xA;straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is&#xA;included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for&#xA;making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means&#xA;all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated&#xA;interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation&#xA;and installation of the library.&#xA;&#xA;  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not&#xA;covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of&#xA;running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from&#xA;such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based&#xA;on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for&#xA;writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does&#xA;and what the program that uses the Library does.&#xA;  &#xA;  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library&apos;s&#xA;complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that&#xA;you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an&#xA;appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact&#xA;all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any&#xA;warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the&#xA;Library.&#xA;&#xA;  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,&#xA;and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a&#xA;fee.&#xA;&#xA;  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion&#xA;of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and&#xA;distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1&#xA;above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;&#xA;    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.&#xA;&#xA;    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices&#xA;    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.&#xA;&#xA;    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no&#xA;    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.&#xA;&#xA;    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a&#xA;    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses&#xA;    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility&#xA;    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,&#xA;    in the event an application does not supply such function or&#xA;    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of&#xA;    its purpose remains meaningful.&#xA;&#xA;    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has&#xA;    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the&#xA;    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any&#xA;    application-supplied function or table used by this function must&#xA;    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square&#xA;    root function must still compute square roots.)&#xA;&#xA;These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If&#xA;identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,&#xA;and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in&#xA;themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those&#xA;sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you&#xA;distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based&#xA;on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of&#xA;this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the&#xA;entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote&#xA;it.&#xA;&#xA;Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest&#xA;your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to&#xA;exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or&#xA;collective works based on the Library.&#xA;&#xA;In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library&#xA;with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of&#xA;a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under&#xA;the scope of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public&#xA;License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do&#xA;this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so&#xA;that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,&#xA;instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the&#xA;ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify&#xA;that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in&#xA;these notices.&#xA;&#xA;  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for&#xA;that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all&#xA;subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.&#xA;&#xA;  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of&#xA;the Library into a program that is not a library.&#xA;&#xA;  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or&#xA;derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form&#xA;under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany&#xA;it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which&#xA;must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a&#xA;medium customarily used for software interchange.&#xA;&#xA;  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy&#xA;from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the&#xA;source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to&#xA;distribute the source code, even though third parties are not&#xA;compelled to copy the source along with the object code.&#xA;&#xA;  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the&#xA;Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or&#xA;linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;.  Such a&#xA;work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and&#xA;therefore falls outside the scope of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library&#xA;creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it&#xA;contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses the&#xA;library&quot;.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.&#xA;Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.&#xA;&#xA;  When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header file&#xA;that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a&#xA;derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.&#xA;Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be&#xA;linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The&#xA;threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.&#xA;&#xA;  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data&#xA;structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline&#xA;functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object&#xA;file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative&#xA;work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the&#xA;Library will still fall under Section 6.)&#xA;&#xA;  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may&#xA;distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.&#xA;Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,&#xA;whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.&#xA;&#xA;  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or&#xA;link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce a&#xA;work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work&#xA;under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit&#xA;modification of the work for the customer&apos;s own use and reverse&#xA;engineering for debugging such modifications.&#xA;&#xA;  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the&#xA;Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by&#xA;this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work&#xA;during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the&#xA;copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference&#xA;directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one&#xA;of these things:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding&#xA;    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever&#xA;    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under&#xA;    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked&#xA;    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that&#xA;    uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that the&#xA;    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified&#xA;    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood&#xA;    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the&#xA;    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application&#xA;    to use the modified definitions.)&#xA;&#xA;    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the&#xA;    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a&#xA;    copy of the library already present on the user&apos;s computer system,&#xA;    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)&#xA;    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if&#xA;    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is&#xA;    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.&#xA;&#xA;    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at&#xA;    least three years, to give the same user the materials&#xA;    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more&#xA;    than the cost of performing this distribution.&#xA;&#xA;    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy&#xA;    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above&#xA;    specified materials from the same place.&#xA;&#xA;    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these&#xA;    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.&#xA;&#xA;  For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the&#xA;Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for&#xA;reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,&#xA;the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is&#xA;normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major&#xA;components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on&#xA;which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies&#xA;the executable.&#xA;&#xA;  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license&#xA;restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally&#xA;accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot&#xA;use both them and the Library together in an executable that you&#xA;distribute.&#xA;&#xA;  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the&#xA;Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library&#xA;facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined&#xA;library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on&#xA;the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise&#xA;permitted, and provided that you do these two things:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work&#xA;    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library&#xA;    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the&#xA;    Sections above.&#xA;&#xA;    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact&#xA;    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining&#xA;    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.&#xA;&#xA;  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute&#xA;the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any&#xA;attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or&#xA;distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your&#xA;rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,&#xA;or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses&#xA;terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.&#xA;&#xA;  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not&#xA;signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or&#xA;distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are&#xA;prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by&#xA;modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the&#xA;Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and&#xA;all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying&#xA;the Library or works based on it.&#xA;&#xA;  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the&#xA;Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the&#xA;original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library&#xA;subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further&#xA;restrictions on the recipients&apos; exercise of the rights granted herein.&#xA;You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with&#xA;this License.&#xA;&#xA;  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent&#xA;infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),&#xA;conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot&#xA;distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you&#xA;may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent&#xA;license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by&#xA;all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then&#xA;the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to&#xA;refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.&#xA;&#xA;If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any&#xA;particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,&#xA;and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.&#xA;&#xA;It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any&#xA;patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any&#xA;such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the&#xA;integrity of the free software distribution system which is&#xA;implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made&#xA;generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed&#xA;through that system in reliance on consistent application of that&#xA;system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing&#xA;to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot&#xA;impose that choice.&#xA;&#xA;This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to&#xA;be a consequence of the rest of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in&#xA;certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the&#xA;original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add&#xA;an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,&#xA;so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus&#xA;excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if&#xA;written in the body of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new&#xA;versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.&#xA;Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,&#xA;but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.&#xA;&#xA;Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library&#xA;specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and&#xA;&quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and&#xA;conditions either of that version or of any later version published by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a&#xA;license version number, you may choose any version ever published by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation.&#xA;&#xA;  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free&#xA;programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,&#xA;write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is&#xA;copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free&#xA;Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our&#xA;decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status&#xA;of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing&#xA;and reuse of software generally.&#xA;&#xA;       NO WARRANTY&#xA;&#xA;  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO&#xA;WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.&#xA;EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR&#xA;OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY&#xA;KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE&#xA;IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#xA;PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE&#xA;LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME&#xA;THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;&#xA;  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN&#xA;WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY&#xA;AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU&#xA;FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR&#xA;CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE&#xA;LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING&#xA;RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A&#xA;FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF&#xA;SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH&#xA;DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;       END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;&#xA;           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries&#xA;&#xA;  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest&#xA;possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that&#xA;everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting&#xA;redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the&#xA;ordinary General Public License).&#xA;&#xA;  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is&#xA;safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively&#xA;convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the&#xA;&quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.&#xA;&#xA;    &lt;one line to give the library&apos;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;&#xA;    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;&#xA;&#xA;    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or&#xA;    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either&#xA;    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.&#xA;&#xA;    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,&#xA;    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of&#xA;    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU&#xA;    Lesser General Public License for more details.&#xA;&#xA;    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software&#xA;    Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA&#xA;&#xA;Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.&#xA;&#xA;You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your&#xA;school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the library, if&#xA;necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:&#xA;&#xA;  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the&#xA;  library `Frob&apos; (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.&#xA;&#xA;  &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1990&#xA;  Ty Coon, President of Vice&#xA;&#xA;That&apos;s all there is to it!

          GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;Version 2.1, February 1999&#xA;Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.&#xA;59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA&#xA;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies&#xA;of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.&#xA;[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also&#xA;counts&#xA;as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2,&#xA;hence&#xA;the version number 2.1.]&#xA;Preamble&#xA;The licenses for most software are designed to take away your&#xA;freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General&#xA;Public&#xA;Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and&#xA;change&#xA;free software--to make sure the software is free for all its&#xA;users.&#xA;This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some&#xA;specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of&#xA;the&#xA;Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use&#xA;it.  You&#xA;can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about&#xA;whether&#xA;this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better&#xA;strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations&#xA;below.&#xA;When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of&#xA;use,&#xA;not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make&#xA;sure that&#xA;you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and&#xA;charge&#xA;for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or&#xA;can get&#xA;it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces&#xA;of&#xA;it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can&#xA;do&#xA;these things.&#xA;To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid&#xA;distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender&#xA;these&#xA;rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities&#xA;for&#xA;you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify&#xA;it.&#xA;For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether&#xA;gratis&#xA;or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that&#xA;we gave&#xA;you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the&#xA;source&#xA;code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide&#xA;complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink&#xA;them&#xA;with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling&#xA;it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.&#xA;We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright&#xA;the&#xA;library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal&#xA;permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.&#xA;To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that&#xA;there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library&#xA;is&#xA;modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should&#xA;know&#xA;that what they have is not the original version, so that the&#xA;original&#xA;author&apos;s reputation will not be affected by problems that might&#xA;be&#xA;introduced by others.&#xA;Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence&#xA;of&#xA;any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot&#xA;effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining&#xA;a&#xA;restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist&#xA;that&#xA;any patent license obtained for a version of the library must&#xA;be&#xA;consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.&#xA;Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the&#xA;ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser&#xA;General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries,&#xA;and&#xA;is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.&#xA;We use&#xA;this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking&#xA;those&#xA;libraries into non-free programs.&#xA;When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or&#xA;using&#xA;a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking&#xA;a&#xA;combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary&#xA;General Public License therefore permits such linking only if&#xA;the&#xA;entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser&#xA;General&#xA;Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code&#xA;with&#xA;the library.&#xA;We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because&#xA;it&#xA;does Less to protect the user&apos;s freedom than the ordinary General&#xA;Public License.  It also provides other free software developers&#xA;Less&#xA;of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages&#xA;are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for&#xA;many&#xA;libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in&#xA;certain&#xA;special circumstances.&#xA;For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to&#xA;encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that&#xA;it becomes&#xA;a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must&#xA;be&#xA;allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free&#xA;library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.&#xA;In this&#xA;case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to&#xA;free&#xA;software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.&#xA;In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free&#xA;programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body&#xA;of&#xA;free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library&#xA;in&#xA;non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU&#xA;operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating&#xA;system.&#xA;Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective&#xA;of the&#xA;users&apos; freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that&#xA;is&#xA;linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to&#xA;run&#xA;that program using a modified version of the Library.&#xA;The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between&#xA;a&#xA;&quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;.&#xA;The&#xA;former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter&#xA;must&#xA;be combined with the library in order to run.&#xA;GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION&#xA;0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or&#xA;other&#xA;program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder&#xA;or&#xA;other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the&#xA;terms of&#xA;this Lesser General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;).&#xA;Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.&#xA;A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data&#xA;prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs&#xA;(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.&#xA;The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or&#xA;work&#xA;which has been distributed under these terms.  A &quot;work based&#xA;on the&#xA;Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under&#xA;copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library&#xA;or a&#xA;portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated&#xA;straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation&#xA;is&#xA;included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)&#xA;&quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work&#xA;for&#xA;making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code&#xA;means&#xA;all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated&#xA;interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control&#xA;compilation&#xA;and installation of the library.&#xA;Activities other than copying, distribution and modification&#xA;are not&#xA;covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act&#xA;of&#xA;running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output&#xA;from&#xA;such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work&#xA;based&#xA;on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool&#xA;for&#xA;writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library&#xA;does&#xA;and what the program that uses the Library does.&#xA;1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library&apos;s&#xA;complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided&#xA;that&#xA;you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an&#xA;appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep&#xA;intact&#xA;all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence&#xA;of any&#xA;warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the&#xA;Library.&#xA;You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,&#xA;and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange&#xA;for a&#xA;fee.&#xA;2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion&#xA;of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and&#xA;distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section&#xA;1&#xA;above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;a) The modified work must itself be a software library.&#xA;b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices&#xA;stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.&#xA;c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no&#xA;charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.&#xA;d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function&#xA;or a&#xA;table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses&#xA;the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility&#xA;is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure&#xA;that,&#xA;in the event an application does not supply such function or&#xA;table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part&#xA;of&#xA;its purpose remains meaningful.&#xA;(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots&#xA;has&#xA;a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the&#xA;application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any&#xA;application-supplied function or table used by this function&#xA;must&#xA;be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square&#xA;root function must still compute square roots.)&#xA;These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If&#xA;identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,&#xA;and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works&#xA;in&#xA;themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to&#xA;those&#xA;sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when&#xA;you&#xA;distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work&#xA;based&#xA;on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the&#xA;terms of&#xA;this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to&#xA;the&#xA;entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who&#xA;wrote&#xA;it.&#xA;Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or&#xA;contest&#xA;your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent&#xA;is to&#xA;exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative&#xA;or&#xA;collective works based on the Library.&#xA;In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the&#xA;Library&#xA;with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume&#xA;of&#xA;a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work&#xA;under&#xA;the scope of this License.&#xA;3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General&#xA;Public&#xA;License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.&#xA;To do&#xA;this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License,&#xA;so&#xA;that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version&#xA;2,&#xA;instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version&#xA;2 of the&#xA;ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can&#xA;specify&#xA;that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change&#xA;in&#xA;these notices.&#xA;Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible&#xA;for&#xA;that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies&#xA;to all&#xA;subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.&#xA;This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code&#xA;of&#xA;the Library into a program that is not a library.&#xA;4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or&#xA;derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable&#xA;form&#xA;under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany&#xA;it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code,&#xA;which&#xA;must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above&#xA;on a&#xA;medium customarily used for software interchange.&#xA;If distribution of object code is made by offering access to&#xA;copy&#xA;from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy&#xA;the&#xA;source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to&#xA;distribute the source code, even though third parties are not&#xA;compelled to copy the source along with the object code.&#xA;5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the&#xA;Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled&#xA;or&#xA;linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;.  Such&#xA;a&#xA;work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library,&#xA;and&#xA;therefore falls outside the scope of this License.&#xA;However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library&#xA;creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because&#xA;it&#xA;contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses&#xA;the&#xA;library&quot;.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.&#xA;Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.&#xA;When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header&#xA;file&#xA;that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may&#xA;be a&#xA;derivative work of the Library even though the source code is&#xA;not.&#xA;Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can&#xA;be&#xA;linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.&#xA;The&#xA;threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.&#xA;If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data&#xA;structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline&#xA;functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the&#xA;object&#xA;file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative&#xA;work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions&#xA;of the&#xA;Library will still fall under Section 6.)&#xA;Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may&#xA;distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section&#xA;6.&#xA;Any executables containing that work also fall under Section&#xA;6,&#xA;whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.&#xA;6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine&#xA;or&#xA;link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce&#xA;a&#xA;work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that&#xA;work&#xA;under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit&#xA;modification of the work for the customer&apos;s own use and reverse&#xA;engineering for debugging such modifications.&#xA;You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that&#xA;the&#xA;Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered&#xA;by&#xA;this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the&#xA;work&#xA;during execution displays copyright notices, you must include&#xA;the&#xA;copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference&#xA;directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must&#xA;do one&#xA;of these things:&#xA;a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding&#xA;machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever&#xA;changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under&#xA;Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked&#xA;with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that&#xA;uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that&#xA;the&#xA;user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified&#xA;executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood&#xA;that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in&#xA;the&#xA;Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application&#xA;to use the modified definitions.)&#xA;b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the&#xA;Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time&#xA;a&#xA;copy of the library already present on the user&apos;s computer system,&#xA;rather than copying library functions into the executable, and&#xA;(2)&#xA;will operate properly with a modified version of the library,&#xA;if&#xA;the user installs one, as long as the modified version is&#xA;interface-compatible with the version that the work was made&#xA;with.&#xA;c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at&#xA;least three years, to give the same user the materials&#xA;specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more&#xA;than the cost of performing this distribution.&#xA;d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to&#xA;copy&#xA;from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the&#xA;above&#xA;specified materials from the same place.&#xA;e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these&#xA;materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.&#xA;For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the&#xA;Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for&#xA;reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,&#xA;the materials to be distributed need not include anything that&#xA;is&#xA;normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the&#xA;major&#xA;components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system&#xA;on&#xA;which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies&#xA;the executable.&#xA;It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license&#xA;restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally&#xA;accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you&#xA;cannot&#xA;use both them and the Library together in an executable that&#xA;you&#xA;distribute.&#xA;7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on&#xA;the&#xA;Library side-by-side in a single library together with other&#xA;library&#xA;facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a&#xA;combined&#xA;library, provided that the separate distribution of the work&#xA;based on&#xA;the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise&#xA;permitted, and provided that you do these two things:&#xA;a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work&#xA;based on the Library, uncombined with any other library&#xA;facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the&#xA;Sections above.&#xA;b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact&#xA;that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining&#xA;where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.&#xA;8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute&#xA;the Library except as expressly provided under this License.&#xA;Any&#xA;attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or&#xA;distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate&#xA;your&#xA;rights under this License.  However, parties who have received&#xA;copies,&#xA;or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses&#xA;terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.&#xA;9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have&#xA;not&#xA;signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify&#xA;or&#xA;distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions&#xA;are&#xA;prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore,&#xA;by&#xA;modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the&#xA;Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do&#xA;so, and&#xA;all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying&#xA;the Library or works based on it.&#xA;10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based&#xA;on the&#xA;Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from&#xA;the&#xA;original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the&#xA;Library&#xA;subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any&#xA;further&#xA;restrictions on the recipients&apos; exercise of the rights granted&#xA;herein.&#xA;You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties&#xA;with&#xA;this License.&#xA;11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of&#xA;patent&#xA;infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),&#xA;conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement&#xA;or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they&#xA;do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot&#xA;distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under&#xA;this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence&#xA;you&#xA;may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent&#xA;license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library&#xA;by&#xA;all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you,&#xA;then&#xA;the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would&#xA;be to&#xA;refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.&#xA;If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable&#xA;under any&#xA;particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended&#xA;to apply,&#xA;and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.&#xA;It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe&#xA;any&#xA;patents or other property right claims or to contest validity&#xA;of any&#xA;such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting&#xA;the&#xA;integrity of the free software distribution system which is&#xA;implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made&#xA;generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed&#xA;through that system in reliance on consistent application of&#xA;that&#xA;system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is&#xA;willing&#xA;to distribute software through any other system and a licensee&#xA;cannot&#xA;impose that choice.&#xA;This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed&#xA;to&#xA;be a consequence of the rest of this License.&#xA;12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted&#xA;in&#xA;certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,&#xA;the&#xA;original copyright holder who places the Library under this License&#xA;may add&#xA;an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those&#xA;countries,&#xA;so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries&#xA;not thus&#xA;excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation&#xA;as if&#xA;written in the body of this License.&#xA;13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new&#xA;versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.&#xA;Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,&#xA;but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.&#xA;Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&#xA;Library&#xA;specifies a version number of this License which applies to it&#xA;and&#xA;&quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms&#xA;and&#xA;conditions either of that version or of any later version published&#xA;by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify&#xA;a&#xA;license version number, you may choose any version ever published&#xA;by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation.&#xA;14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other&#xA;free&#xA;programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with&#xA;these,&#xA;write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which&#xA;is&#xA;copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free&#xA;Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. &#xA;Our&#xA;decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free&#xA;status&#xA;of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the&#xA;sharing&#xA;and reuse of software generally.&#xA;NO WARRANTY&#xA;15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS&#xA;NO&#xA;WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE&#xA;LAW.&#xA;EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS&#xA;AND/OR&#xA;OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF&#xA;ANY&#xA;KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED&#xA;TO, THE&#xA;IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#xA;PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF&#xA;THE&#xA;LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU&#xA;ASSUME&#xA;THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO&#xA;IN&#xA;WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY&#xA;MODIFY&#xA;AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE&#xA;TO YOU&#xA;FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR&#xA;CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO&#xA;USE THE&#xA;LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING&#xA;RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES&#xA;OR A&#xA;FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN&#xA;IF&#xA;SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY&#xA;OF SUCH&#xA;DAMAGES.&#xA;END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries&#xA;If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest&#xA;possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software&#xA;that&#xA;everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting&#xA;redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the&#xA;terms of the&#xA;ordinary General Public License).&#xA;To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.&#xA;It is&#xA;safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most&#xA;effectively&#xA;convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at&#xA;least the&#xA;&quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.&#xA;&lt;one line to give the library&apos;s name and a brief idea of what&#xA;it does.&gt;&#xA;Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;&#xA;This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or&#xA;modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either&#xA;version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.&#xA;This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,&#xA;but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of&#xA;MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the&#xA;GNU&#xA;Lesser General Public License for more details.&#xA;You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software&#xA;Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307&#xA;USA&#xA;Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and&#xA;paper mail.&#xA;You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer)&#xA;or your&#xA;school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the library,&#xA;if&#xA;necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:&#xA;Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the&#xA;library `Frob&apos; (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James&#xA;Random Hacker.&#xA;&lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1990&#xA;Ty Coon, President of Vice&#xA;That&apos;s all there is to it!

          GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;Version 2.1, February 1999&#xA;Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.&#xA;59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA&#xA;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies&#xA;of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.&#xA;[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also&#xA;counts&#xA;as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2,&#xA;hence&#xA;the version number 2.1.]&#xA;Preamble&#xA;The licenses for most software are designed to take away your&#xA;freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General&#xA;Public&#xA;Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and&#xA;change&#xA;free software--to make sure the software is free for all its&#xA;users.&#xA;This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some&#xA;specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of&#xA;the&#xA;Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use&#xA;it.  You&#xA;can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about&#xA;whether&#xA;this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better&#xA;strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations&#xA;below.&#xA;When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of&#xA;use,&#xA;not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make&#xA;sure that&#xA;you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and&#xA;charge&#xA;for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or&#xA;can get&#xA;it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces&#xA;of&#xA;it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can&#xA;do&#xA;these things.&#xA;To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid&#xA;distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender&#xA;these&#xA;rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities&#xA;for&#xA;you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify&#xA;it.&#xA;For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether&#xA;gratis&#xA;or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that&#xA;we gave&#xA;you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the&#xA;source&#xA;code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide&#xA;complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink&#xA;them&#xA;with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling&#xA;it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.&#xA;We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright&#xA;the&#xA;library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal&#xA;permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.&#xA;To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that&#xA;there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library&#xA;is&#xA;modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should&#xA;know&#xA;that what they have is not the original version, so that the&#xA;original&#xA;author&apos;s reputation will not be affected by problems that might&#xA;be&#xA;introduced by others.&#xA;Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence&#xA;of&#xA;any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot&#xA;effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining&#xA;a&#xA;restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist&#xA;that&#xA;any patent license obtained for a version of the library must&#xA;be&#xA;consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.&#xA;Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the&#xA;ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser&#xA;General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries,&#xA;and&#xA;is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.&#xA;We use&#xA;this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking&#xA;those&#xA;libraries into non-free programs.&#xA;When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or&#xA;using&#xA;a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking&#xA;a&#xA;combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary&#xA;General Public License therefore permits such linking only if&#xA;the&#xA;entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser&#xA;General&#xA;Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code&#xA;with&#xA;the library.&#xA;We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because&#xA;it&#xA;does Less to protect the user&apos;s freedom than the ordinary General&#xA;Public License.  It also provides other free software developers&#xA;Less&#xA;of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages&#xA;are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for&#xA;many&#xA;libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in&#xA;certain&#xA;special circumstances.&#xA;For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to&#xA;encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that&#xA;it becomes&#xA;a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must&#xA;be&#xA;allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free&#xA;library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.&#xA;In this&#xA;case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to&#xA;free&#xA;software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.&#xA;In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free&#xA;programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body&#xA;of&#xA;free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library&#xA;in&#xA;non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU&#xA;operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating&#xA;system.&#xA;Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective&#xA;of the&#xA;users&apos; freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that&#xA;is&#xA;linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to&#xA;run&#xA;that program using a modified version of the Library.&#xA;The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between&#xA;a&#xA;&quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;.&#xA;The&#xA;former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter&#xA;must&#xA;be combined with the library in order to run.&#xA;GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION&#xA;0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or&#xA;other&#xA;program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder&#xA;or&#xA;other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the&#xA;terms of&#xA;this Lesser General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;).&#xA;Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.&#xA;A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data&#xA;prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs&#xA;(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.&#xA;The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or&#xA;work&#xA;which has been distributed under these terms.  A &quot;work based&#xA;on the&#xA;Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under&#xA;copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library&#xA;or a&#xA;portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated&#xA;straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation&#xA;is&#xA;included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)&#xA;&quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work&#xA;for&#xA;making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code&#xA;means&#xA;all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated&#xA;interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control&#xA;compilation&#xA;and installation of the library.&#xA;Activities other than copying, distribution and modification&#xA;are not&#xA;covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act&#xA;of&#xA;running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output&#xA;from&#xA;such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work&#xA;based&#xA;on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool&#xA;for&#xA;writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library&#xA;does&#xA;and what the program that uses the Library does.&#xA;1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library&apos;s&#xA;complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided&#xA;that&#xA;you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an&#xA;appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep&#xA;intact&#xA;all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence&#xA;of any&#xA;warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the&#xA;Library.&#xA;You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,&#xA;and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange&#xA;for a&#xA;fee.&#xA;2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion&#xA;of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and&#xA;distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section&#xA;1&#xA;above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;a) The modified work must itself be a software library.&#xA;b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices&#xA;stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.&#xA;c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no&#xA;charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.&#xA;d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function&#xA;or a&#xA;table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses&#xA;the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility&#xA;is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure&#xA;that,&#xA;in the event an application does not supply such function or&#xA;table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part&#xA;of&#xA;its purpose remains meaningful.&#xA;(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots&#xA;has&#xA;a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the&#xA;application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any&#xA;application-supplied function or table used by this function&#xA;must&#xA;be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square&#xA;root function must still compute square roots.)&#xA;These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If&#xA;identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,&#xA;and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works&#xA;in&#xA;themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to&#xA;those&#xA;sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when&#xA;you&#xA;distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work&#xA;based&#xA;on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the&#xA;terms of&#xA;this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to&#xA;the&#xA;entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who&#xA;wrote&#xA;it.&#xA;Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or&#xA;contest&#xA;your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent&#xA;is to&#xA;exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative&#xA;or&#xA;collective works based on the Library.&#xA;In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the&#xA;Library&#xA;with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume&#xA;of&#xA;a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work&#xA;under&#xA;the scope of this License.&#xA;3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General&#xA;Public&#xA;License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.&#xA;To do&#xA;this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License,&#xA;so&#xA;that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version&#xA;2,&#xA;instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version&#xA;2 of the&#xA;ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can&#xA;specify&#xA;that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change&#xA;in&#xA;these notices.&#xA;Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible&#xA;for&#xA;that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies&#xA;to all&#xA;subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.&#xA;This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code&#xA;of&#xA;the Library into a program that is not a library.&#xA;4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or&#xA;derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable&#xA;form&#xA;under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany&#xA;it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code,&#xA;which&#xA;must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above&#xA;on a&#xA;medium customarily used for software interchange.&#xA;If distribution of object code is made by offering access to&#xA;copy&#xA;from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy&#xA;the&#xA;source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to&#xA;distribute the source code, even though third parties are not&#xA;compelled to copy the source along with the object code.&#xA;5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the&#xA;Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled&#xA;or&#xA;linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;.  Such&#xA;a&#xA;work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library,&#xA;and&#xA;therefore falls outside the scope of this License.&#xA;However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library&#xA;creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because&#xA;it&#xA;contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses&#xA;the&#xA;library&quot;.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.&#xA;Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.&#xA;When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header&#xA;file&#xA;that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may&#xA;be a&#xA;derivative work of the Library even though the source code is&#xA;not.&#xA;Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can&#xA;be&#xA;linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.&#xA;The&#xA;threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.&#xA;If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data&#xA;structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline&#xA;functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the&#xA;object&#xA;file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative&#xA;work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions&#xA;of the&#xA;Library will still fall under Section 6.)&#xA;Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may&#xA;distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section&#xA;6.&#xA;Any executables containing that work also fall under Section&#xA;6,&#xA;whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.&#xA;6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine&#xA;or&#xA;link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce&#xA;a&#xA;work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that&#xA;work&#xA;under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit&#xA;modification of the work for the customer&apos;s own use and reverse&#xA;engineering for debugging such modifications.&#xA;You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that&#xA;the&#xA;Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered&#xA;by&#xA;this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the&#xA;work&#xA;during execution displays copyright notices, you must include&#xA;the&#xA;copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference&#xA;directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must&#xA;do one&#xA;of these things:&#xA;a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding&#xA;machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever&#xA;changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under&#xA;Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked&#xA;with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that&#xA;uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that&#xA;the&#xA;user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified&#xA;executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood&#xA;that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in&#xA;the&#xA;Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application&#xA;to use the modified definitions.)&#xA;b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the&#xA;Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time&#xA;a&#xA;copy of the library already present on the user&apos;s computer system,&#xA;rather than copying library functions into the executable, and&#xA;(2)&#xA;will operate properly with a modified version of the library,&#xA;if&#xA;the user installs one, as long as the modified version is&#xA;interface-compatible with the version that the work was made&#xA;with.&#xA;c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at&#xA;least three years, to give the same user the materials&#xA;specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more&#xA;than the cost of performing this distribution.&#xA;d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to&#xA;copy&#xA;from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the&#xA;above&#xA;specified materials from the same place.&#xA;e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these&#xA;materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.&#xA;For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the&#xA;Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for&#xA;reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,&#xA;the materials to be distributed need not include anything that&#xA;is&#xA;normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the&#xA;major&#xA;components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system&#xA;on&#xA;which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies&#xA;the executable.&#xA;It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license&#xA;restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally&#xA;accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you&#xA;cannot&#xA;use both them and the Library together in an executable that&#xA;you&#xA;distribute.&#xA;7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on&#xA;the&#xA;Library side-by-side in a single library together with other&#xA;library&#xA;facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a&#xA;combined&#xA;library, provided that the separate distribution of the work&#xA;based on&#xA;the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise&#xA;permitted, and provided that you do these two things:&#xA;a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work&#xA;based on the Library, uncombined with any other library&#xA;facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the&#xA;Sections above.&#xA;b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact&#xA;that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining&#xA;where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.&#xA;8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute&#xA;the Library except as expressly provided under this License.&#xA;Any&#xA;attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or&#xA;distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate&#xA;your&#xA;rights under this License.  However, parties who have received&#xA;copies,&#xA;or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses&#xA;terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.&#xA;9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have&#xA;not&#xA;signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify&#xA;or&#xA;distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions&#xA;are&#xA;prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore,&#xA;by&#xA;modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the&#xA;Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do&#xA;so, and&#xA;all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying&#xA;the Library or works based on it.&#xA;10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based&#xA;on the&#xA;Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from&#xA;the&#xA;original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the&#xA;Library&#xA;subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any&#xA;further&#xA;restrictions on the recipients&apos; exercise of the rights granted&#xA;herein.&#xA;You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties&#xA;with&#xA;this License.&#xA;11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of&#xA;patent&#xA;infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),&#xA;conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement&#xA;or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they&#xA;do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot&#xA;distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under&#xA;this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence&#xA;you&#xA;may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent&#xA;license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library&#xA;by&#xA;all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you,&#xA;then&#xA;the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would&#xA;be to&#xA;refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.&#xA;If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable&#xA;under any&#xA;particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended&#xA;to apply,&#xA;and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.&#xA;It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe&#xA;any&#xA;patents or other property right claims or to contest validity&#xA;of any&#xA;such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting&#xA;the&#xA;integrity of the free software distribution system which is&#xA;implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made&#xA;generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed&#xA;through that system in reliance on consistent application of&#xA;that&#xA;system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is&#xA;willing&#xA;to distribute software through any other system and a licensee&#xA;cannot&#xA;impose that choice.&#xA;This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed&#xA;to&#xA;be a consequence of the rest of this License.&#xA;12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted&#xA;in&#xA;certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,&#xA;the&#xA;original copyright holder who places the Library under this License&#xA;may add&#xA;an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those&#xA;countries,&#xA;so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries&#xA;not thus&#xA;excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation&#xA;as if&#xA;written in the body of this License.&#xA;13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new&#xA;versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.&#xA;Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,&#xA;but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.&#xA;Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&#xA;Library&#xA;specifies a version number of this License which applies to it&#xA;and&#xA;&quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms&#xA;and&#xA;conditions either of that version or of any later version published&#xA;by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify&#xA;a&#xA;license version number, you may choose any version ever published&#xA;by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation.&#xA;14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other&#xA;free&#xA;programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with&#xA;these,&#xA;write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which&#xA;is&#xA;copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free&#xA;Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. &#xA;Our&#xA;decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free&#xA;status&#xA;of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the&#xA;sharing&#xA;and reuse of software generally.&#xA;NO WARRANTY&#xA;15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS&#xA;NO&#xA;WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE&#xA;LAW.&#xA;EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS&#xA;AND/OR&#xA;OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF&#xA;ANY&#xA;KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED&#xA;TO, THE&#xA;IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#xA;PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF&#xA;THE&#xA;LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU&#xA;ASSUME&#xA;THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO&#xA;IN&#xA;WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY&#xA;MODIFY&#xA;AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE&#xA;TO YOU&#xA;FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR&#xA;CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO&#xA;USE THE&#xA;LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING&#xA;RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES&#xA;OR A&#xA;FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN&#xA;IF&#xA;SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY&#xA;OF SUCH&#xA;DAMAGES.&#xA;END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries&#xA;If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest&#xA;possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software&#xA;that&#xA;everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting&#xA;redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the&#xA;terms of the&#xA;ordinary General Public License).&#xA;To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.&#xA;It is&#xA;safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most&#xA;effectively&#xA;convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at&#xA;least the&#xA;&quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.&#xA;&lt;one line to give the library&apos;s name and a brief idea of what&#xA;it does.&gt;&#xA;Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;&#xA;This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or&#xA;modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either&#xA;version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.&#xA;This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,&#xA;but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of&#xA;MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the&#xA;GNU&#xA;Lesser General Public License for more details.&#xA;You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software&#xA;Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307&#xA;USA&#xA;Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and&#xA;paper mail.&#xA;You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer)&#xA;or your&#xA;school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the library,&#xA;if&#xA;necessary.

          GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;Version 2.1, February 1999&#xA;Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.&#xA;59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA&#xA;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies&#xA;of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.&#xA;[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also&#xA;counts&#xA;as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2,&#xA;hence&#xA;the version number 2.1.]&#xA;Preamble&#xA;The licenses for most software are designed to take away your&#xA;freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General&#xA;Public&#xA;Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and&#xA;change&#xA;free software--to make sure the software is free for all its&#xA;users.&#xA;This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some&#xA;specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of&#xA;the&#xA;Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use&#xA;it.  You&#xA;can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about&#xA;whether&#xA;this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better&#xA;strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations&#xA;below.&#xA;When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of&#xA;use,&#xA;not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make&#xA;sure that&#xA;you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and&#xA;charge&#xA;for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or&#xA;can get&#xA;it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces&#xA;of&#xA;it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can&#xA;do&#xA;these things.&#xA;To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid&#xA;distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender&#xA;these&#xA;rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities&#xA;for&#xA;you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify&#xA;it.&#xA;For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether&#xA;gratis&#xA;or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that&#xA;we gave&#xA;you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the&#xA;source&#xA;code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide&#xA;complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink&#xA;them&#xA;with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling&#xA;it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.&#xA;We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright&#xA;the&#xA;library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal&#xA;permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.&#xA;To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that&#xA;there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library&#xA;is&#xA;modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should&#xA;know&#xA;that what they have is not the original version, so that the&#xA;original&#xA;author&apos;s reputation will not be affected by problems that might&#xA;be&#xA;introduced by others.&#xA;Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence&#xA;of&#xA;any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot&#xA;effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining&#xA;a&#xA;restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist&#xA;that&#xA;any patent license obtained for a version of the library must&#xA;be&#xA;consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.&#xA;Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the&#xA;ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser&#xA;General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries,&#xA;and&#xA;is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.&#xA;We use&#xA;this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking&#xA;those&#xA;libraries into non-free programs.&#xA;When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or&#xA;using&#xA;a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking&#xA;a&#xA;combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary&#xA;General Public License therefore permits such linking only if&#xA;the&#xA;entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser&#xA;General&#xA;Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code&#xA;with&#xA;the library.&#xA;We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because&#xA;it&#xA;does Less to protect the user&apos;s freedom than the ordinary General&#xA;Public License.  It also provides other free software developers&#xA;Less&#xA;of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages&#xA;are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for&#xA;many&#xA;libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in&#xA;certain&#xA;special circumstances.&#xA;For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to&#xA;encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that&#xA;it becomes&#xA;a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must&#xA;be&#xA;allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free&#xA;library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.&#xA;In this&#xA;case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to&#xA;free&#xA;software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.&#xA;In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free&#xA;programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body&#xA;of&#xA;free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library&#xA;in&#xA;non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU&#xA;operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating&#xA;system.&#xA;Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective&#xA;of the&#xA;users&apos; freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that&#xA;is&#xA;linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to&#xA;run&#xA;that program using a modified version of the Library.&#xA;The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between&#xA;a&#xA;&quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;.&#xA;The&#xA;former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter&#xA;must&#xA;be combined with the library in order to run.&#xA;GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION&#xA;0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or&#xA;other&#xA;program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder&#xA;or&#xA;other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the&#xA;terms of&#xA;this Lesser General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;).&#xA;Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.&#xA;A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data&#xA;prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs&#xA;(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.&#xA;The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or&#xA;work&#xA;which has been distributed under these terms.  A &quot;work based&#xA;on the&#xA;Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under&#xA;copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library&#xA;or a&#xA;portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated&#xA;straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation&#xA;is&#xA;included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)&#xA;&quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work&#xA;for&#xA;making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code&#xA;means&#xA;all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated&#xA;interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control&#xA;compilation&#xA;and installation of the library.&#xA;Activities other than copying, distribution and modification&#xA;are not&#xA;covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act&#xA;of&#xA;running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output&#xA;from&#xA;such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work&#xA;based&#xA;on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool&#xA;for&#xA;writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library&#xA;does&#xA;and what the program that uses the Library does.&#xA;1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library&apos;s&#xA;complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided&#xA;that&#xA;you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an&#xA;appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep&#xA;intact&#xA;all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence&#xA;of any&#xA;warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the&#xA;Library.&#xA;You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,&#xA;and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange&#xA;for a&#xA;fee.&#xA;2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion&#xA;of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and&#xA;distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section&#xA;1&#xA;above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;a) The modified work must itself be a software library.&#xA;b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices&#xA;stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.&#xA;c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no&#xA;charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.&#xA;d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function&#xA;or a&#xA;table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses&#xA;the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility&#xA;is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure&#xA;that,&#xA;in the event an application does not supply such function or&#xA;table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part&#xA;of&#xA;its purpose remains meaningful.&#xA;(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots&#xA;has&#xA;a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the&#xA;application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any&#xA;application-supplied function or table used by this function&#xA;must&#xA;be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square&#xA;root function must still compute square roots.)&#xA;These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If&#xA;identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,&#xA;and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works&#xA;in&#xA;themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to&#xA;those&#xA;sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when&#xA;you&#xA;distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work&#xA;based&#xA;on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the&#xA;terms of&#xA;this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to&#xA;the&#xA;entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who&#xA;wrote&#xA;it.&#xA;Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or&#xA;contest&#xA;your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent&#xA;is to&#xA;exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative&#xA;or&#xA;collective works based on the Library.&#xA;In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the&#xA;Library&#xA;with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume&#xA;of&#xA;a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work&#xA;under&#xA;the scope of this License.&#xA;3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General&#xA;Public&#xA;License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.&#xA;To do&#xA;this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License,&#xA;so&#xA;that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version&#xA;2,&#xA;instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version&#xA;2 of the&#xA;ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can&#xA;specify&#xA;that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change&#xA;in&#xA;these notices.&#xA;Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible&#xA;for&#xA;that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies&#xA;to all&#xA;subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.&#xA;This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code&#xA;of&#xA;the Library into a program that is not a library.&#xA;4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or&#xA;derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable&#xA;form&#xA;under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany&#xA;it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code,&#xA;which&#xA;must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above&#xA;on a&#xA;medium customarily used for software interchange.&#xA;If distribution of object code is made by offering access to&#xA;copy&#xA;from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy&#xA;the&#xA;source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to&#xA;distribute the source code, even though third parties are not&#xA;compelled to copy the source along with the object code.&#xA;5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the&#xA;Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled&#xA;or&#xA;linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;.  Such&#xA;a&#xA;work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library,&#xA;and&#xA;therefore falls outside the scope of this License.&#xA;However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library&#xA;creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because&#xA;it&#xA;contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses&#xA;the&#xA;library&quot;.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.&#xA;Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.&#xA;When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header&#xA;file&#xA;that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may&#xA;be a&#xA;derivative work of the Library even though the source code is&#xA;not.&#xA;Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can&#xA;be&#xA;linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.&#xA;The&#xA;threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.&#xA;If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data&#xA;structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline&#xA;functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the&#xA;object&#xA;file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative&#xA;work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions&#xA;of the&#xA;Library will still fall under Section 6.)&#xA;Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may&#xA;distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section&#xA;6.&#xA;Any executables containing that work also fall under Section&#xA;6,&#xA;whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.&#xA;6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine&#xA;or&#xA;link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce&#xA;a&#xA;work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that&#xA;work&#xA;under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit&#xA;modification of the work for the customer&apos;s own use and reverse&#xA;engineering for debugging such modifications.&#xA;You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that&#xA;the&#xA;Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered&#xA;by&#xA;this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the&#xA;work&#xA;during execution displays copyright notices, you must include&#xA;the&#xA;copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference&#xA;directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must&#xA;do one&#xA;of these things:&#xA;a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding&#xA;machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever&#xA;changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under&#xA;Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked&#xA;with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that&#xA;uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that&#xA;the&#xA;user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified&#xA;executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood&#xA;that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in&#xA;the&#xA;Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application&#xA;to use the modified definitions.)&#xA;b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the&#xA;Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time&#xA;a&#xA;copy of the library already present on the user&apos;s computer system,&#xA;rather than copying library functions into the executable, and&#xA;(2)&#xA;will operate properly with a modified version of the library,&#xA;if&#xA;the user installs one, as long as the modified version is&#xA;interface-compatible with the version that the work was made&#xA;with.&#xA;c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at&#xA;least three years, to give the same user the materials&#xA;specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more&#xA;than the cost of performing this distribution.&#xA;d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to&#xA;copy&#xA;from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the&#xA;above&#xA;specified materials from the same place.&#xA;e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these&#xA;materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.&#xA;For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the&#xA;Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for&#xA;reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,&#xA;the materials to be distributed need not include anything that&#xA;is&#xA;normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the&#xA;major&#xA;components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system&#xA;on&#xA;which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies&#xA;the executable.&#xA;It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license&#xA;restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally&#xA;accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you&#xA;cannot&#xA;use both them and the Library together in an executable that&#xA;you&#xA;distribute.&#xA;7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on&#xA;the&#xA;Library side-by-side in a single library together with other&#xA;library&#xA;facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a&#xA;combined&#xA;library, provided that the separate distribution of the work&#xA;based on&#xA;the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise&#xA;permitted, and provided that you do these two things:&#xA;a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work&#xA;based on the Library, uncombined with any other library&#xA;facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the&#xA;Sections above.&#xA;b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact&#xA;that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining&#xA;where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.&#xA;8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute&#xA;the Library except as expressly provided under this License.&#xA;Any&#xA;attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or&#xA;distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate&#xA;your&#xA;rights under this License.  However, parties who have received&#xA;copies,&#xA;or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses&#xA;terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.&#xA;9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have&#xA;not&#xA;signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify&#xA;or&#xA;distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions&#xA;are&#xA;prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore,&#xA;by&#xA;modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the&#xA;Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do&#xA;so, and&#xA;all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying&#xA;the Library or works based on it.&#xA;10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based&#xA;on the&#xA;Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from&#xA;the&#xA;original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the&#xA;Library&#xA;subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any&#xA;further&#xA;restrictions on the recipients&apos; exercise of the rights granted&#xA;herein.&#xA;You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties&#xA;with&#xA;this License.&#xA;11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of&#xA;patent&#xA;infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),&#xA;conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement&#xA;or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they&#xA;do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot&#xA;distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under&#xA;this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence&#xA;you&#xA;may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent&#xA;license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library&#xA;by&#xA;all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you,&#xA;then&#xA;the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would&#xA;be to&#xA;refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.&#xA;If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable&#xA;under any&#xA;particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended&#xA;to apply,&#xA;and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.&#xA;It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe&#xA;any&#xA;patents or other property right claims or to contest validity&#xA;of any&#xA;such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting&#xA;the&#xA;integrity of the free software distribution system which is&#xA;implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made&#xA;generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed&#xA;through that system in reliance on consistent application of&#xA;that&#xA;system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is&#xA;willing&#xA;to distribute software through any other system and a licensee&#xA;cannot&#xA;impose that choice.&#xA;This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed&#xA;to&#xA;be a consequence of the rest of this License.&#xA;12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted&#xA;in&#xA;certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,&#xA;the&#xA;original copyright holder who places the Library under this License&#xA;may add&#xA;an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those&#xA;countries,&#xA;so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries&#xA;not thus&#xA;excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation&#xA;as if&#xA;written in the body of this License.&#xA;13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new&#xA;versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.&#xA;Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,&#xA;but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.&#xA;Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&#xA;Library&#xA;specifies a version number of this License which applies to it&#xA;and&#xA;&quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms&#xA;and&#xA;conditions either of that version or of any later version published&#xA;by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify&#xA;a&#xA;license version number, you may choose any version ever published&#xA;by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation.&#xA;14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other&#xA;free&#xA;programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with&#xA;these,&#xA;write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which&#xA;is&#xA;copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free&#xA;Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. &#xA;Our&#xA;decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free&#xA;status&#xA;of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the&#xA;sharing&#xA;and reuse of software generally.&#xA;NO WARRANTY&#xA;15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS&#xA;NO&#xA;WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE&#xA;LAW.&#xA;EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS&#xA;AND/OR&#xA;OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF&#xA;ANY&#xA;KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED&#xA;TO, THE&#xA;IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#xA;PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF&#xA;THE&#xA;LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU&#xA;ASSUME&#xA;THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO&#xA;IN&#xA;WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY&#xA;MODIFY&#xA;AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE&#xA;TO YOU&#xA;FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR&#xA;CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO&#xA;USE THE&#xA;LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING&#xA;RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES&#xA;OR A&#xA;FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN&#xA;IF&#xA;SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY&#xA;OF SUCH&#xA;DAMAGES.&#xA;END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries&#xA;If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest&#xA;possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software&#xA;that&#xA;everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting&#xA;redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the&#xA;terms of the&#xA;ordinary General Public License).&#xA;To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.&#xA;It is&#xA;safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most&#xA;effectively&#xA;convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at&#xA;least the&#xA;&quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.&#xA;&lt;one line to give the library&apos;s name and a brief idea of what&#xA;it does.&gt;&#xA;Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;&#xA;This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or&#xA;modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either&#xA;version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.&#xA;This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,&#xA;but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of&#xA;MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the&#xA;GNU&#xA;Lesser General Public License for more details.&#xA;You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software&#xA;Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307&#xA;USA&#xA;Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and&#xA;paper mail.&#xA;You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer)&#xA;or your&#xA;school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the library,&#xA;if&#xA;necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:&#xA;Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the&#xA;library `Frob&apos; (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James&#xA;Random Hacker.&#xA;&lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1990&#xA;Ty Coon, President of Vice&#xA;That&apos;s all there is to it!

It also&#xA;counts&#xA;as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2,&#xA;hence&#xA;the version number 2.1.]&#xA;Preamble&#xA;The licenses for most software are designed to take away your&#xA;freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General&#xA;Public&#xA;Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and&#xA;change&#xA;free software--to make sure the software is free for all its&#xA;users.&#xA;This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some&#xA;specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of&#xA;the&#xA;Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use&#xA;it.  You&#xA;can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about&#xA;whether&#xA;this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better&#xA;strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations&#xA;below.&#xA;When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of&#xA;use,&#xA;not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make&#xA;sure that&#xA;you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and&#xA;charge&#xA;for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or&#xA;can get&#xA;it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces&#xA;of&#xA;it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can&#xA;do&#xA;these things.&#xA;To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid&#xA;distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender&#xA;these&#xA;rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities&#xA;for&#xA;you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify&#xA;it.&#xA;For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether&#xA;gratis&#xA;or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that&#xA;we gave&#xA;you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the&#xA;source&#xA;code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide&#xA;complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink&#xA;them&#xA;with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling&#xA;it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.&#xA;We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright&#xA;the&#xA;library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal&#xA;permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.&#xA;To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that&#xA;there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library&#xA;is&#xA;modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should&#xA;know&#xA;that what they have is not the original version, so that the&#xA;original&#xA;author&apos;s reputation will not be affected by problems that might&#xA;be&#xA;introduced by others.&#xA;Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence&#xA;of&#xA;any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot&#xA;effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining&#xA;a&#xA;restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist&#xA;that&#xA;any patent license obtained for a version of the library must&#xA;be&#xA;consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.&#xA;Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the&#xA;ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser&#xA;General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries,&#xA;and&#xA;is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.&#xA;We use&#xA;this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking&#xA;those&#xA;libraries into non-free programs.&#xA;When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or&#xA;using&#xA;a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking&#xA;a&#xA;combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary&#xA;General Public License therefore permits such linking only if&#xA;the&#xA;entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser&#xA;General&#xA;Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code&#xA;with&#xA;the library.&#xA;We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because&#xA;it&#xA;does Less to protect the user&apos;s freedom than the ordinary General&#xA;Public License.  It also provides other free software developers&#xA;Less&#xA;of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages&#xA;are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for&#xA;many&#xA;libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in&#xA;certain&#xA;special circumstances.&#xA;For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to&#xA;encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that&#xA;it becomes&#xA;a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must&#xA;be&#xA;allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free&#xA;library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.&#xA;In this&#xA;case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to&#xA;free&#xA;software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.&#xA;In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free&#xA;programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body&#xA;of&#xA;free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library&#xA;in&#xA;non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU&#xA;operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating&#xA;system.&#xA;Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective&#xA;of the&#xA;users&apos; freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that&#xA;is&#xA;linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to&#xA;run&#xA;that program using a modified version of the Library.&#xA;The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between&#xA;a&#xA;&quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;.&#xA;The&#xA;former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter&#xA;must&#xA;be combined with the library in order to run.&#xA;GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION&#xA;0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or&#xA;other&#xA;program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder&#xA;or&#xA;other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the&#xA;terms of&#xA;this Lesser General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;).&#xA;Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.&#xA;A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data&#xA;prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs&#xA;(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.&#xA;The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or&#xA;work&#xA;which has been distributed under these terms.  A &quot;work based&#xA;on the&#xA;Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under&#xA;copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library&#xA;or a&#xA;portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated&#xA;straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation&#xA;is&#xA;included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)&#xA;&quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work&#xA;for&#xA;making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code&#xA;means&#xA;all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated&#xA;interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control&#xA;compilation&#xA;and installation of the library.&#xA;Activities other than copying, distribution and modification&#xA;are not&#xA;covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act&#xA;of&#xA;running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output&#xA;from&#xA;such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work&#xA;based&#xA;on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool&#xA;for&#xA;writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library&#xA;does&#xA;and what the program that uses the Library does.&#xA;1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library&apos;s&#xA;complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided&#xA;that&#xA;you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an&#xA;appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep&#xA;intact&#xA;all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence&#xA;of any&#xA;warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the&#xA;Library.&#xA;You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,&#xA;and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange&#xA;for a&#xA;fee.&#xA;2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion&#xA;of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and&#xA;distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section&#xA;1&#xA;above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;a) The modified work must itself be a software library.&#xA;b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices&#xA;stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.&#xA;c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no&#xA;charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.&#xA;d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function&#xA;or a&#xA;table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses&#xA;the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility&#xA;is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure&#xA;that,&#xA;in the event an application does not supply such function or&#xA;table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part&#xA;of&#xA;its purpose remains meaningful.&#xA;(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots&#xA;has&#xA;a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the&#xA;application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any&#xA;application-supplied function or table used by this function&#xA;must&#xA;be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square&#xA;root function must still compute square roots.)&#xA;These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If&#xA;identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,&#xA;and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works&#xA;in&#xA;themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to&#xA;those&#xA;sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when&#xA;you&#xA;distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work&#xA;based&#xA;on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the&#xA;terms of&#xA;this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to&#xA;the&#xA;entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who&#xA;wrote&#xA;it.&#xA;Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or&#xA;contest&#xA;your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent&#xA;is to&#xA;exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative&#xA;or&#xA;collective works based on the Library.&#xA;In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the&#xA;Library&#xA;with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume&#xA;of&#xA;a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work&#xA;under&#xA;the scope of this License.&#xA;3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General&#xA;Public&#xA;License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.&#xA;To do&#xA;this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License,&#xA;so&#xA;that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version&#xA;2,&#xA;instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version&#xA;2 of the&#xA;ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can&#xA;specify&#xA;that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change&#xA;in&#xA;these notices.&#xA;Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible&#xA;for&#xA;that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies&#xA;to all&#xA;subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.&#xA;This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code&#xA;of&#xA;the Library into a program that is not a library.&#xA;4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or&#xA;derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable&#xA;form&#xA;under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany&#xA;it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code,&#xA;which&#xA;must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above&#xA;on a&#xA;medium customarily used for software interchange.&#xA;If distribution of object code is made by offering access to&#xA;copy&#xA;from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy&#xA;the&#xA;source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to&#xA;distribute the source code, even though third parties are not&#xA;compelled to copy the source along with the object code.&#xA;5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the&#xA;Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled&#xA;or&#xA;linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;.  Such&#xA;a&#xA;work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library,&#xA;and&#xA;therefore falls outside the scope of this License.&#xA;However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library&#xA;creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because&#xA;it&#xA;contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses&#xA;the&#xA;library&quot;.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.&#xA;Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.&#xA;When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header&#xA;file&#xA;that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may&#xA;be a&#xA;derivative work of the Library even though the source code is&#xA;not.&#xA;Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can&#xA;be&#xA;linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.&#xA;The&#xA;threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.&#xA;If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data&#xA;structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline&#xA;functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the&#xA;object&#xA;file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative&#xA;work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions&#xA;of the&#xA;Library will still fall under Section 6.)&#xA;Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may&#xA;distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section&#xA;6.&#xA;Any executables containing that work also fall under Section&#xA;6,&#xA;whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.&#xA;6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine&#xA;or&#xA;link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce&#xA;a&#xA;work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that&#xA;work&#xA;under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit&#xA;modification of the work for the customer&apos;s own use and reverse&#xA;engineering for debugging such modifications.&#xA;You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that&#xA;the&#xA;Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered&#xA;by&#xA;this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the&#xA;work&#xA;during execution displays copyright notices, you must include&#xA;the&#xA;copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference&#xA;directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must&#xA;do one&#xA;of these things:&#xA;a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding&#xA;machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever&#xA;changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under&#xA;Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked&#xA;with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that&#xA;uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that&#xA;the&#xA;user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified&#xA;executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood&#xA;that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in&#xA;the&#xA;Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application&#xA;to use the modified definitions.)&#xA;b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the&#xA;Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time&#xA;a&#xA;copy of the library already present on the user&apos;s computer system,&#xA;rather than copying library functions into the executable, and&#xA;(2)&#xA;will operate properly with a modified version of the library,&#xA;if&#xA;the user installs one, as long as the modified version is&#xA;interface-compatible with the version that the work was made&#xA;with.&#xA;c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at&#xA;least three years, to give the same user the materials&#xA;specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more&#xA;than the cost of performing this distribution.&#xA;d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to&#xA;copy&#xA;from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the&#xA;above&#xA;specified materials from the same place.&#xA;e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these&#xA;materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.&#xA;For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the&#xA;Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for&#xA;reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,&#xA;the materials to be distributed need not include anything that&#xA;is&#xA;normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the&#xA;major&#xA;components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system&#xA;on&#xA;which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies&#xA;the executable.&#xA;It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license&#xA;restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally&#xA;accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you&#xA;cannot&#xA;use both them and the Library together in an executable that&#xA;you&#xA;distribute.&#xA;7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on&#xA;the&#xA;Library side-by-side in a single library together with other&#xA;library&#xA;facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a&#xA;combined&#xA;library, provided that the separate distribution of the work&#xA;based on&#xA;the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise&#xA;permitted, and provided that you do these two things:&#xA;a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work&#xA;based on the Library, uncombined with any other library&#xA;facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the&#xA;Sections above.&#xA;b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact&#xA;that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining&#xA;where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.&#xA;8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute&#xA;the Library except as expressly provided under this License.&#xA;Any&#xA;attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or&#xA;distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate&#xA;your&#xA;rights under this License.  However, parties who have received&#xA;copies,&#xA;or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses&#xA;terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.&#xA;9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have&#xA;not&#xA;signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify&#xA;or&#xA;distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions&#xA;are&#xA;prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore,&#xA;by&#xA;modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the&#xA;Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do&#xA;so, and&#xA;all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying&#xA;the Library or works based on it.&#xA;10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based&#xA;on the&#xA;Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from&#xA;the&#xA;original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the&#xA;Library&#xA;subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any&#xA;further&#xA;restrictions on the recipients&apos; exercise of the rights granted&#xA;herein.&#xA;You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties&#xA;with&#xA;this License.&#xA;11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of&#xA;patent&#xA;infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),&#xA;conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement&#xA;or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they&#xA;do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot&#xA;distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under&#xA;this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence&#xA;you&#xA;may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent&#xA;license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library&#xA;by&#xA;all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you,&#xA;then&#xA;the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would&#xA;be to&#xA;refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.&#xA;If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable&#xA;under any&#xA;particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended&#xA;to apply,&#xA;and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.&#xA;It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe&#xA;any&#xA;patents or other property right claims or to contest validity&#xA;of any&#xA;such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting&#xA;the&#xA;integrity of the free software distribution system which is&#xA;implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made&#xA;generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed&#xA;through that system in reliance on consistent application of&#xA;that&#xA;system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is&#xA;willing&#xA;to distribute software through any other system and a licensee&#xA;cannot&#xA;impose that choice.&#xA;This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed&#xA;to&#xA;be a consequence of the rest of this License.&#xA;12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted&#xA;in&#xA;certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,&#xA;the&#xA;original copyright holder who places the Library under this License&#xA;may add&#xA;an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those&#xA;countries,&#xA;so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries&#xA;not thus&#xA;excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation&#xA;as if&#xA;written in the body of this License.&#xA;13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new&#xA;versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.&#xA;Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,&#xA;but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.&#xA;Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&#xA;Library&#xA;specifies a version number of this License which applies to it&#xA;and&#xA;&quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms&#xA;and&#xA;conditions either of that version or of any later version published&#xA;by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify&#xA;a&#xA;license version number, you may choose any version ever published&#xA;by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation.&#xA;14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other&#xA;free&#xA;programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with&#xA;these,&#xA;write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which&#xA;is&#xA;copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free&#xA;Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. &#xA;Our&#xA;decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free&#xA;status&#xA;of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the&#xA;sharing&#xA;and reuse of software generally.&#xA;NO WARRANTY&#xA;15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS&#xA;NO&#xA;WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE&#xA;LAW.&#xA;EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS&#xA;AND/OR&#xA;OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF&#xA;ANY&#xA;KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED&#xA;TO, THE&#xA;IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#xA;PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF&#xA;THE&#xA;LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU&#xA;ASSUME&#xA;THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO&#xA;IN&#xA;WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY&#xA;MODIFY&#xA;AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE&#xA;TO YOU&#xA;FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR&#xA;CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO&#xA;USE THE&#xA;LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING&#xA;RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES&#xA;OR A&#xA;FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN&#xA;IF&#xA;SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY&#xA;OF SUCH&#xA;DAMAGES.&#xA;END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries&#xA;If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest&#xA;possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software&#xA;that&#xA;everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting&#xA;redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the&#xA;terms of the&#xA;ordinary General Public License).&#xA;To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.&#xA;It is&#xA;safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most&#xA;effectively&#xA;convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at&#xA;least the&#xA;&quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.&#xA;&lt;one line to give the library&apos;s name and a brief idea of what&#xA;it does.&gt;&#xA;Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;&#xA;This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or&#xA;modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either&#xA;version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.&#xA;This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,&#xA;but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of&#xA;MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the&#xA;GNU&#xA;Lesser General Public License for more details.&#xA;You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software&#xA;Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307&#xA;USA&#xA;Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and&#xA;paper mail.&#xA;You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer)&#xA;or your&#xA;school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the library,&#xA;if&#xA;necessary.

          GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;         Version 2.1, February 1999&#xA;&#xA; Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.&#xA;     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA&#xA; Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies&#xA; of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.&#xA;&#xA;[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts&#xA; as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence&#xA; the version number 2.1.]&#xA;&#xA;       Preamble&#xA;&#xA;  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your&#xA;freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public&#xA;Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change&#xA;free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.&#xA;&#xA;  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some&#xA;specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the&#xA;Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You&#xA;can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether&#xA;this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better&#xA;strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.&#xA;&#xA;  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,&#xA;not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that&#xA;you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge&#xA;for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get&#xA;it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of&#xA;it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do&#xA;these things.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid&#xA;distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these&#xA;rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for&#xA;you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis&#xA;or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave&#xA;you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source&#xA;code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide&#xA;complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them&#xA;with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling&#xA;it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.&#xA;&#xA;  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the&#xA;library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal&#xA;permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that&#xA;there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is&#xA;modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know&#xA;that what they have is not the original version, so that the original&#xA;author&apos;s reputation will not be affected by problems that might be&#xA;introduced by others.&#xA;&#xA;  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of&#xA;any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot&#xA;effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a&#xA;restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that&#xA;any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be&#xA;consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.&#xA;&#xA;  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the&#xA;ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser&#xA;General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and&#xA;is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use&#xA;this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those&#xA;libraries into non-free programs.&#xA;&#xA;  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using&#xA;a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a&#xA;combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary&#xA;General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the&#xA;entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General&#xA;Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with&#xA;the library.&#xA;&#xA;  We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because it&#xA;does Less to protect the user&apos;s freedom than the ordinary General&#xA;Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less&#xA;of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages&#xA;are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many&#xA;libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain&#xA;special circumstances.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to&#xA;encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes&#xA;a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be&#xA;allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free&#xA;library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this&#xA;case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free&#xA;software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free&#xA;programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of&#xA;free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in&#xA;non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU&#xA;operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating&#xA;system.&#xA;&#xA;  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the&#xA;users&apos; freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is&#xA;linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run&#xA;that program using a modified version of the Library.&#xA;&#xA;  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a&#xA;&quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;.  The&#xA;former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must&#xA;be combined with the library in order to run.&#xA;&#xA;    GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION&#xA;&#xA;  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other&#xA;program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or&#xA;other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of&#xA;this Lesser General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;).&#xA;Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data&#xA;prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs&#xA;(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work&#xA;which has been distributed under these terms.  A &quot;work based on the&#xA;Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under&#xA;copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a&#xA;portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated&#xA;straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is&#xA;included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for&#xA;making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means&#xA;all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated&#xA;interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation&#xA;and installation of the library.&#xA;&#xA;  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not&#xA;covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of&#xA;running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from&#xA;such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based&#xA;on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for&#xA;writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does&#xA;and what the program that uses the Library does.&#xA;  &#xA;  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library&apos;s&#xA;complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that&#xA;you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an&#xA;appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact&#xA;all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any&#xA;warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the&#xA;Library.&#xA;&#xA;  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,&#xA;and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a&#xA;fee.&#xA;&#xA;  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion&#xA;of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and&#xA;distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1&#xA;above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;&#xA;    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.&#xA;&#xA;    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices&#xA;    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.&#xA;&#xA;    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no&#xA;    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.&#xA;&#xA;    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a&#xA;    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses&#xA;    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility&#xA;    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,&#xA;    in the event an application does not supply such function or&#xA;    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of&#xA;    its purpose remains meaningful.&#xA;&#xA;    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has&#xA;    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the&#xA;    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any&#xA;    application-supplied function or table used by this function must&#xA;    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square&#xA;    root function must still compute square roots.)&#xA;&#xA;These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If&#xA;identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,&#xA;and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in&#xA;themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those&#xA;sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you&#xA;distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based&#xA;on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of&#xA;this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the&#xA;entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote&#xA;it.&#xA;&#xA;Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest&#xA;your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to&#xA;exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or&#xA;collective works based on the Library.&#xA;&#xA;In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library&#xA;with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of&#xA;a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under&#xA;the scope of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public&#xA;License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do&#xA;this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so&#xA;that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,&#xA;instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the&#xA;ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify&#xA;that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in&#xA;these notices.&#xA;&#xA;  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for&#xA;that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all&#xA;subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.&#xA;&#xA;  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of&#xA;the Library into a program that is not a library.&#xA;&#xA;  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or&#xA;derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form&#xA;under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany&#xA;it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which&#xA;must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a&#xA;medium customarily used for software interchange.&#xA;&#xA;  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy&#xA;from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the&#xA;source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to&#xA;distribute the source code, even though third parties are not&#xA;compelled to copy the source along with the object code.&#xA;&#xA;  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the&#xA;Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or&#xA;linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;.  Such a&#xA;work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and&#xA;therefore falls outside the scope of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library&#xA;creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it&#xA;contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses the&#xA;library&quot;.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.&#xA;Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.&#xA;&#xA;  When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header file&#xA;that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a&#xA;derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.&#xA;Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be&#xA;linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The&#xA;threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.&#xA;&#xA;  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data&#xA;structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline&#xA;functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object&#xA;file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative&#xA;work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the&#xA;Library will still fall under Section 6.)&#xA;&#xA;  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may&#xA;distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.&#xA;Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,&#xA;whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.&#xA;&#xA;  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or&#xA;link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce a&#xA;work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work&#xA;under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit&#xA;modification of the work for the customer&apos;s own use and reverse&#xA;engineering for debugging such modifications.&#xA;&#xA;  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the&#xA;Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by&#xA;this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work&#xA;during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the&#xA;copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference&#xA;directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one&#xA;of these things:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding&#xA;    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever&#xA;    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under&#xA;    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked&#xA;    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that&#xA;    uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that the&#xA;    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified&#xA;    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood&#xA;    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the&#xA;    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application&#xA;    to use the modified definitions.)&#xA;&#xA;    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the&#xA;    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a&#xA;    copy of the library already present on the user&apos;s computer system,&#xA;    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)&#xA;    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if&#xA;    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is&#xA;    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.&#xA;&#xA;    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at&#xA;    least three years, to give the same user the materials&#xA;    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more&#xA;    than the cost of performing this distribution.&#xA;&#xA;    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy&#xA;    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above&#xA;    specified materials from the same place.&#xA;&#xA;    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these&#xA;    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.&#xA;&#xA;  For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the&#xA;Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for&#xA;reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,&#xA;the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is&#xA;normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major&#xA;components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on&#xA;which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies&#xA;the executable.&#xA;&#xA;  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license&#xA;restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally&#xA;accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot&#xA;use both them and the Library together in an executable that you&#xA;distribute.&#xA;&#xA;  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the&#xA;Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library&#xA;facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined&#xA;library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on&#xA;the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise&#xA;permitted, and provided that you do these two things:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work&#xA;    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library&#xA;    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the&#xA;    Sections above.&#xA;&#xA;    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact&#xA;    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining&#xA;    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.&#xA;&#xA;  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute&#xA;the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any&#xA;attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or&#xA;distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your&#xA;rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,&#xA;or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses&#xA;terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.&#xA;&#xA;  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not&#xA;signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or&#xA;distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are&#xA;prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by&#xA;modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the&#xA;Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and&#xA;all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying&#xA;the Library or works based on it.&#xA;&#xA;  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the&#xA;Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the&#xA;original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library&#xA;subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further&#xA;restrictions on the recipients&apos; exercise of the rights granted herein.&#xA;You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with&#xA;this License.&#xA;&#xA;  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent&#xA;infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),&#xA;conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot&#xA;distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you&#xA;may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent&#xA;license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by&#xA;all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then&#xA;the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to&#xA;refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.&#xA;&#xA;If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any&#xA;particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,&#xA;and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.&#xA;&#xA;It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any&#xA;patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any&#xA;such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the&#xA;integrity of the free software distribution system which is&#xA;implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made&#xA;generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed&#xA;through that system in reliance on consistent application of that&#xA;system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing&#xA;to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot&#xA;impose that choice.&#xA;&#xA;This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to&#xA;be a consequence of the rest of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in&#xA;certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the&#xA;original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add&#xA;an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,&#xA;so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus&#xA;excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if&#xA;written in the body of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new&#xA;versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.&#xA;Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,&#xA;but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.&#xA;&#xA;Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library&#xA;specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and&#xA;&quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and&#xA;conditions either of that version or of any later version published by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a&#xA;license version number, you may choose any version ever published by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation.&#xA;&#xA;  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free&#xA;programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,&#xA;write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is&#xA;copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free&#xA;Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our&#xA;decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status&#xA;of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing&#xA;and reuse of software generally.&#xA;&#xA;       NO WARRANTY&#xA;&#xA;  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO&#xA;WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.&#xA;EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR&#xA;OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY&#xA;KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE&#xA;IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#xA;PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE&#xA;LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME&#xA;THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;&#xA;  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN&#xA;WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY&#xA;AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU&#xA;FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR&#xA;CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE&#xA;LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING&#xA;RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A&#xA;FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF&#xA;SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH&#xA;DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;       END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;&#xA;           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries&#xA;&#xA;  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest&#xA;possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that&#xA;everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting&#xA;redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the&#xA;ordinary General Public License).&#xA;&#xA;  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is&#xA;safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively&#xA;convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the&#xA;&quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.&#xA;&#xA;    &lt;one line to give the library&apos;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;&#xA;    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;&#xA;&#xA;    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or&#xA;    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either&#xA;    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.&#xA;&#xA;    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,&#xA;    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of&#xA;    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU&#xA;    Lesser General Public License for more details.&#xA;&#xA;    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software&#xA;    Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA&#xA;&#xA;Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.&#xA;&#xA;You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your&#xA;school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the library, if&#xA;necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:&#xA;&#xA;  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the&#xA;  library `Frob&apos; (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.&#xA;&#xA;  &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1990&#xA;  Ty Coon, President of Vice&#xA;&#xA;That&apos;s all there is to it!

          GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 2.1, February 1999&#xA;&#xA;  Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 59&#xA;  Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA Everyone is&#xA;  permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license&#xA;  document, but changing it is not allowed.&#xA;&#xA;  [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also&#xA;  counts as the successor of the GNU Library Public License,&#xA;  version 2, hence the version number 2.1.]&#xA;&#xA;  Preamble&#xA;&#xA;  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your&#xA;  freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General&#xA;  Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share&#xA;  and change free software--to make sure the software is free for&#xA;  all its users.&#xA;&#xA;  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some&#xA;  specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of&#xA;  the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use&#xA;  it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully&#xA;  about whether this license or the ordinary General Public&#xA;  License is the better strategy to use in any particular case,&#xA;  based on the explanations below.&#xA;&#xA;  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of&#xA;  use, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make&#xA;  sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free&#xA;  software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you&#xA;  receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can&#xA;  change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs;&#xA;  and that you are informed that you can do these things.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid&#xA;  distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender&#xA;  these rights. These restrictions translate to certain&#xA;  responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library&#xA;  or if you modify it.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether&#xA;  gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights&#xA;  that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or&#xA;  can get the source code. If you link other code with the&#xA;  library, you must provide complete object files to the&#xA;  recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after&#xA;  making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must&#xA;  show them these terms so they know their rights.&#xA;&#xA;  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright&#xA;  the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you&#xA;  legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that&#xA;  there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library&#xA;  is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should&#xA;  know that what they have is not the original version, so that&#xA;  the original author&apos;s reputation will not be affected by&#xA;  problems that might be introduced by others.&#xA;&#xA;  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the&#xA;  existence of any free program. We wish to make sure that a&#xA;  company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program&#xA;  by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder.&#xA;  Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a&#xA;  version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom&#xA;  of use specified in this license.&#xA;&#xA;  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the&#xA;  ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU&#xA;  Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated&#xA;  libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General&#xA;  Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in&#xA;  order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.&#xA;&#xA;  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or&#xA;  using a shared library, the combination of the two is legally&#xA;  speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library.&#xA;  The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such&#xA;  linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of&#xA;  freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax&#xA;  criteria for linking other code with the library.&#xA;&#xA;  We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public&#xA;  License because it does Less to protect the user&apos;s freedom&#xA;  than the ordinary General Public License. It also provides other&#xA;  free software developers Less of an advantage over competing&#xA;  non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the&#xA;  ordinary General Public License for many libraries. However, the&#xA;  Lesser license provides advantages in certain special&#xA;  circumstances.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to&#xA;  encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that&#xA;  it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free&#xA;  programs must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent&#xA;  case is that a free library does the same job as widely used&#xA;  non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by&#xA;  limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the&#xA;  Lesser General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in&#xA;  non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a&#xA;  large body of free software. For example, permission to use the&#xA;  GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to&#xA;  use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the&#xA;  GNU/Linux operating system.&#xA;&#xA;  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of&#xA;  the users&apos; freedom, it does ensure that the user of a&#xA;  program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the&#xA;  wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the&#xA;  Library.&#xA;&#xA;  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;  modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference&#xA;  between a &quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work&#xA;  that uses the library&quot;. The former contains code derived&#xA;  from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the&#xA;  library in order to run.&#xA;&#xA;  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR&#xA;  COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION&#xA;&#xA;  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or&#xA;  other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright&#xA;  holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed&#xA;  under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also&#xA;  called &quot;this License&quot;). Each licensee is addressed as&#xA;  &quot;you&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions&#xA;  and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with&#xA;  application programs (which use some of those functions and&#xA;  data) to form executables.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software&#xA;  library or work which has been distributed under these terms. A&#xA;  &quot;work based on the Library&quot; means either the Library&#xA;  or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a&#xA;  work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim&#xA;  or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into&#xA;  another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without&#xA;  limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of&#xA;  the work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete&#xA;  source code means all the source code for all modules it&#xA;  contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus&#xA;  the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the&#xA;  library.&#xA;&#xA;  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are&#xA;  not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act&#xA;  of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and&#xA;  output from such a program is covered only if its contents&#xA;  constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use&#xA;  of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true&#xA;  depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses&#xA;  the Library does.&#xA;&#xA;  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the&#xA;  Library&apos;s complete source code as you receive it, in any&#xA;  medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately&#xA;  publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and&#xA;  disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer&#xA;  to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and&#xA;  distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.&#xA;&#xA;  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a&#xA;  copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in&#xA;  exchange for a fee.&#xA;&#xA;  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any&#xA;  portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and&#xA;  copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms&#xA;  of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these&#xA;  conditions:&#xA;&#xA;  a) The modified work must itself be a software library.&#xA;&#xA;  b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices&#xA;  stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.&#xA;&#xA;  c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no&#xA;  charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or&#xA;  a table of data to be supplied by an application program that&#xA;  uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the&#xA;  facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to&#xA;  ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such&#xA;  function or table, the facility still operates, and performs&#xA;  whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.&#xA;&#xA;  (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots&#xA;  has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the&#xA;  application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any&#xA;  application-supplied function or table used by this function&#xA;  must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the&#xA;  square root function must still compute square roots.)&#xA;&#xA;  These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If&#xA;  identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the&#xA;  Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and&#xA;  separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms,&#xA;  do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as&#xA;  separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as&#xA;  part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the&#xA;  distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License,&#xA;  whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire&#xA;  whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote&#xA;  it.&#xA;&#xA;  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or&#xA;  contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the&#xA;  intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of&#xA;  derivative or collective works based on the Library.&#xA;&#xA;  In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the&#xA;  Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library)&#xA;  on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring&#xA;  the other work under the scope of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General&#xA;  Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the&#xA;  Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer&#xA;  to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General&#xA;  Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a&#xA;  newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public&#xA;  License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead&#xA;  if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.&#xA;&#xA;  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for&#xA;  that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to&#xA;  all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.&#xA;&#xA;  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of&#xA;  the Library into a program that is not a library.&#xA;&#xA;  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or&#xA;  derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable&#xA;  form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you&#xA;  accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable&#xA;  source code, which must be distributed under the terms of&#xA;  Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software&#xA;  interchange.&#xA;&#xA;  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to&#xA;  copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to&#xA;  copy the source code from the same place satisfies the&#xA;  requirement to distribute the source code, even though third&#xA;  parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the&#xA;  object code.&#xA;&#xA;  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the&#xA;  Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being&#xA;  compiled or linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the&#xA;  Library&quot;. Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative&#xA;  work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of&#xA;  this License.&#xA;&#xA;  However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with&#xA;  the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the&#xA;  Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather&#xA;  than a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;. The executable is&#xA;  therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for&#xA;  distribution of such executables.&#xA;&#xA;  When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from&#xA;  a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for&#xA;  the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the&#xA;  source code is not. Whether this is true is especially&#xA;  significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if&#xA;  the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true&#xA;  is not precisely defined by law.&#xA;&#xA;  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data&#xA;  structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small&#xA;  inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of&#xA;  the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is&#xA;  legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object&#xA;  code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section&#xA;  6.)&#xA;&#xA;  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may&#xA;  distribute the object code for the work under the terms of&#xA;  Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under&#xA;  Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the&#xA;  Library itself.&#xA;&#xA;  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine&#xA;  or link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the&#xA;  Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library,&#xA;  and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided&#xA;  that the terms permit modification of the work for the&#xA;  customer&apos;s own use and reverse engineering for debugging&#xA;  such modifications.&#xA;&#xA;  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that&#xA;  the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are&#xA;  covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License.&#xA;  If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you&#xA;  must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as&#xA;  well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this&#xA;  License. Also, you must do one of these things:&#xA;&#xA;  a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding&#xA;  machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever&#xA;  changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under&#xA;  Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable&#xA;  linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable&#xA;  &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or&#xA;  source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then&#xA;  relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified&#xA;  Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the&#xA;  contents of definitions files in the Library will not&#xA;  necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the&#xA;  modified definitions.)&#xA;&#xA;  b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the&#xA;  Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a&#xA;  copy of the library already present on the user&apos;s computer&#xA;  system, rather than copying library functions into the&#xA;  executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified&#xA;  version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the&#xA;  modified version is interface-compatible with the version that&#xA;  the work was made with.&#xA;&#xA;  c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least&#xA;  three years, to give the same user the materials specified in&#xA;  Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of&#xA;  performing this distribution.&#xA;&#xA;  d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to&#xA;  copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy&#xA;  the above specified materials from the same place.&#xA;&#xA;  e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these&#xA;  materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.&#xA;&#xA;  For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses&#xA;  the Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs&#xA;  needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a&#xA;  special exception, the materials to be distributed need not&#xA;  include anything that is normally distributed (in either source&#xA;  or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and&#xA;  so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs,&#xA;  unless that component itself accompanies the executable.&#xA;&#xA;  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license&#xA;  restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally&#xA;  accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you&#xA;  cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable&#xA;  that you distribute.&#xA;&#xA;  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the&#xA;  Library side-by-side in a single library together with other&#xA;  library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute&#xA;  such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution&#xA;  of the work based on the Library and of the other library&#xA;  facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do&#xA;  these two things:&#xA;&#xA;  a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work&#xA;  based on the Library, uncombined with any other library&#xA;  facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the&#xA;  Sections above.&#xA;&#xA;  b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact&#xA;  that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining&#xA;  where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.&#xA;&#xA;  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or&#xA;  distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this&#xA;  License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link&#xA;  with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically&#xA;  terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who&#xA;  have received copies, or rights, from you under this License&#xA;  will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties&#xA;  remain in full compliance.&#xA;&#xA;  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have&#xA;  not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to&#xA;  modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These&#xA;  actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.&#xA;  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work&#xA;  based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this&#xA;  License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,&#xA;  distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.&#xA;&#xA;  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on&#xA;  the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license&#xA;  from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or&#xA;  modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You&#xA;  may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients&apos;&#xA;  exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible&#xA;  for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.&#xA;&#xA;  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of&#xA;  patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to&#xA;  patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court&#xA;  order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of&#xA;  this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this&#xA;  License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy&#xA;  simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other&#xA;  pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not&#xA;  distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license&#xA;  would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by&#xA;  all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you,&#xA;  then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License&#xA;  would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.&#xA;&#xA;  If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable&#xA;  under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is&#xA;  intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to&#xA;  apply in other circumstances.&#xA;&#xA;  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe&#xA;  any patents or other property right claims or to contest&#xA;  validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose&#xA;  of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution&#xA;  system which is implemented by public license practices. Many&#xA;  people have made generous contributions to the wide range of&#xA;  software distributed through that system in reliance on&#xA;  consistent application of that system; it is up to the&#xA;  author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute&#xA;  software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose&#xA;  that choice.&#xA;&#xA;  This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is&#xA;  believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted&#xA;  in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted&#xA;  interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library&#xA;  under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution&#xA;  limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is&#xA;  permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such&#xA;  case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in&#xA;  the body of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new&#xA;  versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.&#xA;  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present&#xA;  version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or&#xA;  concerns.&#xA;&#xA;  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the&#xA;  Library specifies a version number of this License which applies&#xA;  to it and &quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of&#xA;  following the terms and conditions either of that version or of&#xA;  any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If&#xA;  the Library does not specify a license version number, you may&#xA;  choose any version ever published by the Free Software&#xA;  Foundation.&#xA;&#xA;  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other&#xA;  free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible&#xA;  with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For&#xA;  software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation,&#xA;  write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make&#xA;  exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two&#xA;  goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our&#xA;  free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software&#xA;  generally.&#xA;&#xA;  NO WARRANTY&#xA;&#xA;  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO&#xA;  WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE&#xA;  LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT&#xA;  HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS&#xA;  IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR&#xA;  IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES&#xA;  OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE&#xA;  ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS&#xA;  WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE&#xA;  COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;&#xA;  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO&#xA;  IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY&#xA;  MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE&#xA;  LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,&#xA;  INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR&#xA;  INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS&#xA;  OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY&#xA;  YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH&#xA;  ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN&#xA;  ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;  END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;&#xA;  How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries&#xA;&#xA;  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the&#xA;  greatest possible use to the public, we recommend making it free&#xA;  software that everyone can redistribute and change. You can do&#xA;  so by permitting redistribution under these terms (or,&#xA;  alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public&#xA;  License).&#xA;&#xA;  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the&#xA;  library. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source&#xA;  file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and&#xA;  each file should have at least the &quot;copyright&quot; line&#xA;  and a pointer to where the full notice is found.&#xA;&#xA;  &lt;one line to give the library&apos;s name and a brief idea of&#xA;  what it does.&gt; Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt; &lt;name of&#xA;  author&gt;&#xA;&#xA;  This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or&#xA;  modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;  License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either&#xA;  version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later&#xA;  version.&#xA;&#xA;  This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,&#xA;  but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of&#xA;  MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU&#xA;  Lesser General Public License for more details.&#xA;&#xA;  You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;  License along with this library; if not, write to the Free&#xA;  Software Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston,&#xA;  MA 02111-1307 USA&#xA;&#xA;  Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and&#xA;  paper mail.&#xA;&#xA;  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer)&#xA;  or your school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright&#xA;  disclaimer&quot; for the library, if necessary.

          GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;Version 2.1, February 1999&#xA;Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.&#xA;59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA&#xA;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies&#xA;of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.&#xA;[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also&#xA;counts&#xA;as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2,&#xA;hence&#xA;the version number 2.1.]&#xA;Preamble&#xA;The licenses for most software are designed to take away your&#xA;freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General&#xA;Public&#xA;Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and&#xA;change&#xA;free software--to make sure the software is free for all its&#xA;users.&#xA;This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some&#xA;specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of&#xA;the&#xA;Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use&#xA;it.  You&#xA;can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about&#xA;whether&#xA;this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better&#xA;strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations&#xA;below.&#xA;When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of&#xA;use,&#xA;not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make&#xA;sure that&#xA;you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and&#xA;charge&#xA;for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or&#xA;can get&#xA;it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces&#xA;of&#xA;it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can&#xA;do&#xA;these things.&#xA;To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid&#xA;distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender&#xA;these&#xA;rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities&#xA;for&#xA;you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify&#xA;it.&#xA;For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether&#xA;gratis&#xA;or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that&#xA;we gave&#xA;you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the&#xA;source&#xA;code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide&#xA;complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink&#xA;them&#xA;with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling&#xA;it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.&#xA;We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright&#xA;the&#xA;library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal&#xA;permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.&#xA;To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that&#xA;there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library&#xA;is&#xA;modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should&#xA;know&#xA;that what they have is not the original version, so that the&#xA;original&#xA;author&apos;s reputation will not be affected by problems that might&#xA;be&#xA;introduced by others.&#xA;Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence&#xA;of&#xA;any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot&#xA;effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining&#xA;a&#xA;restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist&#xA;that&#xA;any patent license obtained for a version of the library must&#xA;be&#xA;consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.&#xA;Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the&#xA;ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser&#xA;General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries,&#xA;and&#xA;is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.&#xA;We use&#xA;this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking&#xA;those&#xA;libraries into non-free programs.&#xA;When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or&#xA;using&#xA;a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking&#xA;a&#xA;combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary&#xA;General Public License therefore permits such linking only if&#xA;the&#xA;entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser&#xA;General&#xA;Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code&#xA;with&#xA;the library.&#xA;We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because&#xA;it&#xA;does Less to protect the user&apos;s freedom than the ordinary General&#xA;Public License.  It also provides other free software developers&#xA;Less&#xA;of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages&#xA;are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for&#xA;many&#xA;libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in&#xA;certain&#xA;special circumstances.&#xA;For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to&#xA;encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that&#xA;it becomes&#xA;a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must&#xA;be&#xA;allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free&#xA;library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.&#xA;In this&#xA;case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to&#xA;free&#xA;software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.&#xA;In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free&#xA;programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body&#xA;of&#xA;free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library&#xA;in&#xA;non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU&#xA;operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating&#xA;system.&#xA;Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective&#xA;of the&#xA;users&apos; freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that&#xA;is&#xA;linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to&#xA;run&#xA;that program using a modified version of the Library.&#xA;The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between&#xA;a&#xA;&quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;.&#xA;The&#xA;former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter&#xA;must&#xA;be combined with the library in order to run.&#xA;GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION&#xA;0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or&#xA;other&#xA;program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder&#xA;or&#xA;other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the&#xA;terms of&#xA;this Lesser General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;).&#xA;Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.&#xA;A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data&#xA;prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs&#xA;(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.&#xA;The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or&#xA;work&#xA;which has been distributed under these terms.  A &quot;work based&#xA;on the&#xA;Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under&#xA;copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library&#xA;or a&#xA;portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated&#xA;straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation&#xA;is&#xA;included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)&#xA;&quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work&#xA;for&#xA;making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code&#xA;means&#xA;all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated&#xA;interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control&#xA;compilation&#xA;and installation of the library.&#xA;Activities other than copying, distribution and modification&#xA;are not&#xA;covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act&#xA;of&#xA;running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output&#xA;from&#xA;such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work&#xA;based&#xA;on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool&#xA;for&#xA;writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library&#xA;does&#xA;and what the program that uses the Library does.&#xA;1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library&apos;s&#xA;complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided&#xA;that&#xA;you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an&#xA;appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep&#xA;intact&#xA;all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence&#xA;of any&#xA;warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the&#xA;Library.&#xA;You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,&#xA;and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange&#xA;for a&#xA;fee.&#xA;2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion&#xA;of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and&#xA;distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section&#xA;1&#xA;above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;a) The modified work must itself be a software library.&#xA;b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices&#xA;stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.&#xA;c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no&#xA;charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.&#xA;d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function&#xA;or a&#xA;table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses&#xA;the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility&#xA;is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure&#xA;that,&#xA;in the event an application does not supply such function or&#xA;table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part&#xA;of&#xA;its purpose remains meaningful.&#xA;(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots&#xA;has&#xA;a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the&#xA;application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any&#xA;application-supplied function or table used by this function&#xA;must&#xA;be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square&#xA;root function must still compute square roots.)&#xA;These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If&#xA;identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,&#xA;and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works&#xA;in&#xA;themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to&#xA;those&#xA;sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when&#xA;you&#xA;distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work&#xA;based&#xA;on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the&#xA;terms of&#xA;this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to&#xA;the&#xA;entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who&#xA;wrote&#xA;it.&#xA;Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or&#xA;contest&#xA;your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent&#xA;is to&#xA;exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative&#xA;or&#xA;collective works based on the Library.&#xA;In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the&#xA;Library&#xA;with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume&#xA;of&#xA;a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work&#xA;under&#xA;the scope of this License.&#xA;3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General&#xA;Public&#xA;License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.&#xA;To do&#xA;this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License,&#xA;so&#xA;that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version&#xA;2,&#xA;instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version&#xA;2 of the&#xA;ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can&#xA;specify&#xA;that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change&#xA;in&#xA;these notices.&#xA;Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible&#xA;for&#xA;that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies&#xA;to all&#xA;subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.&#xA;This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code&#xA;of&#xA;the Library into a program that is not a library.&#xA;4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or&#xA;derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable&#xA;form&#xA;under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany&#xA;it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code,&#xA;which&#xA;must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above&#xA;on a&#xA;medium customarily used for software interchange.&#xA;If distribution of object code is made by offering access to&#xA;copy&#xA;from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy&#xA;the&#xA;source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to&#xA;distribute the source code, even though third parties are not&#xA;compelled to copy the source along with the object code.&#xA;5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the&#xA;Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled&#xA;or&#xA;linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;.  Such&#xA;a&#xA;work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library,&#xA;and&#xA;therefore falls outside the scope of this License.&#xA;However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library&#xA;creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because&#xA;it&#xA;contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses&#xA;the&#xA;library&quot;.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.&#xA;Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.&#xA;When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header&#xA;file&#xA;that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may&#xA;be a&#xA;derivative work of the Library even though the source code is&#xA;not.&#xA;Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can&#xA;be&#xA;linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.&#xA;The&#xA;threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.&#xA;If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data&#xA;structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline&#xA;functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the&#xA;object&#xA;file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative&#xA;work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions&#xA;of the&#xA;Library will still fall under Section 6.)&#xA;Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may&#xA;distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section&#xA;6.&#xA;Any executables containing that work also fall under Section&#xA;6,&#xA;whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.&#xA;6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine&#xA;or&#xA;link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce&#xA;a&#xA;work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that&#xA;work&#xA;under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit&#xA;modification of the work for the customer&apos;s own use and reverse&#xA;engineering for debugging such modifications.&#xA;You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that&#xA;the&#xA;Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered&#xA;by&#xA;this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the&#xA;work&#xA;during execution displays copyright notices, you must include&#xA;the&#xA;copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference&#xA;directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must&#xA;do one&#xA;of these things:&#xA;a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding&#xA;machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever&#xA;changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under&#xA;Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked&#xA;with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that&#xA;uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that&#xA;the&#xA;user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified&#xA;executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood&#xA;that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in&#xA;the&#xA;Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application&#xA;to use the modified definitions.)&#xA;b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the&#xA;Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time&#xA;a&#xA;copy of the library already present on the user&apos;s computer system,&#xA;rather than copying library functions into the executable, and&#xA;(2)&#xA;will operate properly with a modified version of the library,&#xA;if&#xA;the user installs one, as long as the modified version is&#xA;interface-compatible with the version that the work was made&#xA;with.&#xA;c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at&#xA;least three years, to give the same user the materials&#xA;specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more&#xA;than the cost of performing this distribution.&#xA;d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to&#xA;copy&#xA;from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the&#xA;above&#xA;specified materials from the same place.&#xA;e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these&#xA;materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.&#xA;For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the&#xA;Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for&#xA;reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,&#xA;the materials to be distributed need not include anything that&#xA;is&#xA;normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the&#xA;major&#xA;components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system&#xA;on&#xA;which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies&#xA;the executable.&#xA;It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license&#xA;restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally&#xA;accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you&#xA;cannot&#xA;use both them and the Library together in an executable that&#xA;you&#xA;distribute.&#xA;7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on&#xA;the&#xA;Library side-by-side in a single library together with other&#xA;library&#xA;facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a&#xA;combined&#xA;library, provided that the separate distribution of the work&#xA;based on&#xA;the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise&#xA;permitted, and provided that you do these two things:&#xA;a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work&#xA;based on the Library, uncombined with any other library&#xA;facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the&#xA;Sections above.&#xA;b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact&#xA;that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining&#xA;where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.&#xA;8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute&#xA;the Library except as expressly provided under this License.&#xA;Any&#xA;attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or&#xA;distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate&#xA;your&#xA;rights under this License.  However, parties who have received&#xA;copies,&#xA;or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses&#xA;terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.&#xA;9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have&#xA;not&#xA;signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify&#xA;or&#xA;distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions&#xA;are&#xA;prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore,&#xA;by&#xA;modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the&#xA;Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do&#xA;so, and&#xA;all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying&#xA;the Library or works based on it.&#xA;10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based&#xA;on the&#xA;Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from&#xA;the&#xA;original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the&#xA;Library&#xA;subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any&#xA;further&#xA;restrictions on the recipients&apos; exercise of the rights granted&#xA;herein.&#xA;You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties&#xA;with&#xA;this License.&#xA;11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of&#xA;patent&#xA;infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),&#xA;conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement&#xA;or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they&#xA;do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot&#xA;distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under&#xA;this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence&#xA;you&#xA;may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent&#xA;license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library&#xA;by&#xA;all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you,&#xA;then&#xA;the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would&#xA;be to&#xA;refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.&#xA;If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable&#xA;under any&#xA;particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended&#xA;to apply,&#xA;and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.&#xA;It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe&#xA;any&#xA;patents or other property right claims or to contest validity&#xA;of any&#xA;such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting&#xA;the&#xA;integrity of the free software distribution system which is&#xA;implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made&#xA;generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed&#xA;through that system in reliance on consistent application of&#xA;that&#xA;system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is&#xA;willing&#xA;to distribute software through any other system and a licensee&#xA;cannot&#xA;impose that choice.&#xA;This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed&#xA;to&#xA;be a consequence of the rest of this License.&#xA;12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted&#xA;in&#xA;certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,&#xA;the&#xA;original copyright holder who places the Library under this License&#xA;may add&#xA;an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those&#xA;countries,&#xA;so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries&#xA;not thus&#xA;excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation&#xA;as if&#xA;written in the body of this License.&#xA;13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new&#xA;versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.&#xA;Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,&#xA;but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.&#xA;Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&#xA;Library&#xA;specifies a version number of this License which applies to it&#xA;and&#xA;&quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms&#xA;and&#xA;conditions either of that version or of any later version published&#xA;by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify&#xA;a&#xA;license version number, you may choose any version ever published&#xA;by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation.&#xA;14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other&#xA;free&#xA;programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with&#xA;these,&#xA;write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which&#xA;is&#xA;copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free&#xA;Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. &#xA;Our&#xA;decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free&#xA;status&#xA;of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the&#xA;sharing&#xA;and reuse of software generally.&#xA;NO WARRANTY&#xA;15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS&#xA;NO&#xA;WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE&#xA;LAW.&#xA;EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS&#xA;AND/OR&#xA;OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF&#xA;ANY&#xA;KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED&#xA;TO, THE&#xA;IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#xA;PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF&#xA;THE&#xA;LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU&#xA;ASSUME&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO&#xA;IN&#xA;WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY&#xA;MODIFY&#xA;AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE&#xA;TO YOU&#xA;FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR&#xA;CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO&#xA;USE THE&#xA;LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING&#xA;RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES&#xA;OR A&#xA;FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN&#xA;IF&#xA;SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY&#xA;OF SUCH&#xA;DAMAGES.&#xA;END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries&#xA;If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest&#xA;possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software&#xA;that&#xA;everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting&#xA;redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the&#xA;terms of the&#xA;ordinary General Public License).&#xA;To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.&#xA;It is&#xA;safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most&#xA;effectively&#xA;convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at&#xA;least the&#xA;&quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.&#xA;&lt;one line to give the library&apos;s name and a brief idea of what&#xA;it does.&gt;&#xA;Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;&#xA;This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or&#xA;modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either&#xA;version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.&#xA;This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,&#xA;but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of&#xA;MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the&#xA;GNU&#xA;Lesser General Public License for more details.&#xA;You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software&#xA;Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307&#xA;USA&#xA;Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and&#xA;paper mail.&#xA;You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer)&#xA;or your&#xA;school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the library,&#xA;if&#xA;necessary.

        GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;Version 2.1, February 1999&#xA;Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.&#xA;59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA&#xA;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies&#xA;of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.&#xA;[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also&#xA;counts&#xA;as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2,&#xA;hence&#xA;the version number 2.1.]&#xA;Preamble&#xA;The licenses for most software are designed to take away your&#xA;freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General&#xA;Public&#xA;Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and&#xA;change&#xA;free software--to make sure the software is free for all its&#xA;users.&#xA;This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some&#xA;specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of&#xA;the&#xA;Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use&#xA;it.  You&#xA;can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about&#xA;whether&#xA;this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better&#xA;strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations&#xA;below.&#xA;When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of&#xA;use,&#xA;not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make&#xA;sure that&#xA;you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and&#xA;charge&#xA;for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or&#xA;can get&#xA;it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces&#xA;of&#xA;it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can&#xA;do&#xA;these things.&#xA;To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid&#xA;distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender&#xA;these&#xA;rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities&#xA;for&#xA;you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify&#xA;it.&#xA;For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether&#xA;gratis&#xA;or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that&#xA;we gave&#xA;you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the&#xA;source&#xA;code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide&#xA;complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink&#xA;them&#xA;with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling&#xA;it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.&#xA;We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright&#xA;the&#xA;library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal&#xA;permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.&#xA;To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that&#xA;there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library&#xA;is&#xA;modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should&#xA;know&#xA;that what they have is not the original version, so that the&#xA;original&#xA;author&apos;s reputation will not be affected by problems that might&#xA;be&#xA;introduced by others.&#xA;Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence&#xA;of&#xA;any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot&#xA;effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining&#xA;a&#xA;restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist&#xA;that&#xA;any patent license obtained for a version of the library must&#xA;be&#xA;consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.&#xA;Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the&#xA;ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser&#xA;General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries,&#xA;and&#xA;is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.&#xA;We use&#xA;this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking&#xA;those&#xA;libraries into non-free programs.&#xA;When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or&#xA;using&#xA;a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking&#xA;a&#xA;combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary&#xA;General Public License therefore permits such linking only if&#xA;the&#xA;entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser&#xA;General&#xA;Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code&#xA;with&#xA;the library.&#xA;We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because&#xA;it&#xA;does Less to protect the user&apos;s freedom than the ordinary General&#xA;Public License.  It also provides other free software developers&#xA;Less&#xA;of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages&#xA;are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for&#xA;many&#xA;libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in&#xA;certain&#xA;special circumstances.&#xA;For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to&#xA;encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that&#xA;it becomes&#xA;a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must&#xA;be&#xA;allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free&#xA;library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.&#xA;In this&#xA;case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to&#xA;free&#xA;software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.&#xA;In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free&#xA;programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body&#xA;of&#xA;free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library&#xA;in&#xA;non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU&#xA;operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating&#xA;system.&#xA;Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective&#xA;of the&#xA;users&apos; freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that&#xA;is&#xA;linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to&#xA;run&#xA;that program using a modified version of the Library.&#xA;The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between&#xA;a&#xA;&quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;.&#xA;The&#xA;former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter&#xA;must&#xA;be combined with the library in order to run.&#xA;GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION&#xA;0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or&#xA;other&#xA;program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder&#xA;or&#xA;other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the&#xA;terms of&#xA;this Lesser General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;).&#xA;Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.&#xA;A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data&#xA;prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs&#xA;(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.&#xA;The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or&#xA;work&#xA;which has been distributed under these terms.  A &quot;work based&#xA;on the&#xA;Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under&#xA;copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library&#xA;or a&#xA;portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated&#xA;straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation&#xA;is&#xA;included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)&#xA;&quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work&#xA;for&#xA;making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code&#xA;means&#xA;all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated&#xA;interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control&#xA;compilation&#xA;and installation of the library.&#xA;Activities other than copying, distribution and modification&#xA;are not&#xA;covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act&#xA;of&#xA;running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output&#xA;from&#xA;such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work&#xA;based&#xA;on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool&#xA;for&#xA;writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library&#xA;does&#xA;and what the program that uses the Library does.&#xA;1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library&apos;s&#xA;complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided&#xA;that&#xA;you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an&#xA;appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep&#xA;intact&#xA;all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence&#xA;of any&#xA;warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the&#xA;Library.&#xA;You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,&#xA;and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange&#xA;for a&#xA;fee.&#xA;2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion&#xA;of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and&#xA;distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section&#xA;1&#xA;above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;a) The modified work must itself be a software library.&#xA;b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices&#xA;stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.&#xA;c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no&#xA;charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.&#xA;d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function&#xA;or a&#xA;table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses&#xA;the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility&#xA;is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure&#xA;that,&#xA;in the event an application does not supply such function or&#xA;table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part&#xA;of&#xA;its purpose remains meaningful.&#xA;(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots&#xA;has&#xA;a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the&#xA;application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any&#xA;application-supplied function or table used by this function&#xA;must&#xA;be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square&#xA;root function must still compute square roots.)&#xA;These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If&#xA;identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,&#xA;and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works&#xA;in&#xA;themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to&#xA;those&#xA;sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when&#xA;you&#xA;distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work&#xA;based&#xA;on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the&#xA;terms of&#xA;this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to&#xA;the&#xA;entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who&#xA;wrote&#xA;it.&#xA;Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or&#xA;contest&#xA;your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent&#xA;is to&#xA;exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative&#xA;or&#xA;collective works based on the Library.&#xA;In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the&#xA;Library&#xA;with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume&#xA;of&#xA;a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work&#xA;under&#xA;the scope of this License.&#xA;3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General&#xA;Public&#xA;License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.&#xA;To do&#xA;this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License,&#xA;so&#xA;that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version&#xA;2,&#xA;instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version&#xA;2 of the&#xA;ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can&#xA;specify&#xA;that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change&#xA;in&#xA;these notices.&#xA;Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible&#xA;for&#xA;that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies&#xA;to all&#xA;subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.&#xA;This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code&#xA;of&#xA;the Library into a program that is not a library.&#xA;4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or&#xA;derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable&#xA;form&#xA;under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany&#xA;it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code,&#xA;which&#xA;must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above&#xA;on a&#xA;medium customarily used for software interchange.&#xA;If distribution of object code is made by offering access to&#xA;copy&#xA;from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy&#xA;the&#xA;source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to&#xA;distribute the source code, even though third parties are not&#xA;compelled to copy the source along with the object code.&#xA;5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the&#xA;Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled&#xA;or&#xA;linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;.  Such&#xA;a&#xA;work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library,&#xA;and&#xA;therefore falls outside the scope of this License.&#xA;However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library&#xA;creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because&#xA;it&#xA;contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses&#xA;the&#xA;library&quot;.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.&#xA;Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.&#xA;When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header&#xA;file&#xA;that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may&#xA;be a&#xA;derivative work of the Library even though the source code is&#xA;not.&#xA;Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can&#xA;be&#xA;linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.&#xA;The&#xA;threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.&#xA;If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data&#xA;structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline&#xA;functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the&#xA;object&#xA;file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative&#xA;work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions&#xA;of the&#xA;Library will still fall under Section 6.)&#xA;Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may&#xA;distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section&#xA;6.&#xA;Any executables containing that work also fall under Section&#xA;6,&#xA;whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.&#xA;6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine&#xA;or&#xA;link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce&#xA;a&#xA;work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that&#xA;work&#xA;under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit&#xA;modification of the work for the customer&apos;s own use and reverse&#xA;engineering for debugging such modifications.&#xA;You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that&#xA;the&#xA;Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered&#xA;by&#xA;this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the&#xA;work&#xA;during execution displays copyright notices, you must include&#xA;the&#xA;copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference&#xA;directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must&#xA;do one&#xA;of these things:&#xA;a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding&#xA;machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever&#xA;changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under&#xA;Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked&#xA;with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that&#xA;uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that&#xA;the&#xA;user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified&#xA;executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood&#xA;that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in&#xA;the&#xA;Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application&#xA;to use the modified definitions.)&#xA;b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the&#xA;Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time&#xA;a&#xA;copy of the library already present on the user&apos;s computer system,&#xA;rather than copying library functions into the executable, and&#xA;(2)&#xA;will operate properly with a modified version of the library,&#xA;if&#xA;the user installs one, as long as the modified version is&#xA;interface-compatible with the version that the work was made&#xA;with.&#xA;c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at&#xA;least three years, to give the same user the materials&#xA;specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more&#xA;than the cost of performing this distribution.&#xA;d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to&#xA;copy&#xA;from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the&#xA;above&#xA;specified materials from the same place.&#xA;e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these&#xA;materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.&#xA;For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the&#xA;Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for&#xA;reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,&#xA;the materials to be distributed need not include anything that&#xA;is&#xA;normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the&#xA;major&#xA;components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system&#xA;on&#xA;which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies&#xA;the executable.&#xA;It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license&#xA;restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally&#xA;accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you&#xA;cannot&#xA;use both them and the Library together in an executable that&#xA;you&#xA;distribute.&#xA;7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on&#xA;the&#xA;Library side-by-side in a single library together with other&#xA;library&#xA;facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a&#xA;combined&#xA;library, provided that the separate distribution of the work&#xA;based on&#xA;the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise&#xA;permitted, and provided that you do these two things:&#xA;a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work&#xA;based on the Library, uncombined with any other library&#xA;facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the&#xA;Sections above.&#xA;b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact&#xA;that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining&#xA;where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.&#xA;8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute&#xA;the Library except as expressly provided under this License.&#xA;Any&#xA;attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or&#xA;distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate&#xA;your&#xA;rights under this License.  However, parties who have received&#xA;copies,&#xA;or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses&#xA;terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.&#xA;9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have&#xA;not&#xA;signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify&#xA;or&#xA;distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions&#xA;are&#xA;prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore,&#xA;by&#xA;modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the&#xA;Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do&#xA;so, and&#xA;all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying&#xA;the Library or works based on it.&#xA;10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based&#xA;on the&#xA;Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from&#xA;the&#xA;original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the&#xA;Library&#xA;subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any&#xA;further&#xA;restrictions on the recipients&apos; exercise of the rights granted&#xA;herein.&#xA;You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties&#xA;with&#xA;this License.&#xA;11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of&#xA;patent&#xA;infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),&#xA;conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement&#xA;or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they&#xA;do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot&#xA;distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under&#xA;this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence&#xA;you&#xA;may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent&#xA;license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library&#xA;by&#xA;all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you,&#xA;then&#xA;the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would&#xA;be to&#xA;refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.&#xA;If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable&#xA;under any&#xA;particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended&#xA;to apply,&#xA;and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.&#xA;It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe&#xA;any&#xA;patents or other property right claims or to contest validity&#xA;of any&#xA;such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting&#xA;the&#xA;integrity of the free software distribution system which is&#xA;implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made&#xA;generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed&#xA;through that system in reliance on consistent application of&#xA;that&#xA;system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is&#xA;willing&#xA;to distribute software through any other system and a licensee&#xA;cannot&#xA;impose that choice.&#xA;This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed&#xA;to&#xA;be a consequence of the rest of this License.&#xA;12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted&#xA;in&#xA;certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,&#xA;the&#xA;original copyright holder who places the Library under this License&#xA;may add&#xA;an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those&#xA;countries,&#xA;so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries&#xA;not thus&#xA;excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation&#xA;as if&#xA;written in the body of this License.&#xA;13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new&#xA;versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.&#xA;Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,&#xA;but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.&#xA;Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&#xA;Library&#xA;specifies a version number of this License which applies to it&#xA;and&#xA;&quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms&#xA;and&#xA;conditions either of that version or of any later version published&#xA;by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify&#xA;a&#xA;license version number, you may choose any version ever published&#xA;by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation.&#xA;14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other&#xA;free&#xA;programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with&#xA;these,&#xA;write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which&#xA;is&#xA;copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free&#xA;Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. &#xA;Our&#xA;decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free&#xA;status&#xA;of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the&#xA;sharing&#xA;and reuse of software generally.&#xA;NO WARRANTY&#xA;15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS&#xA;NO&#xA;WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE&#xA;LAW.&#xA;EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS&#xA;AND/OR&#xA;OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF&#xA;ANY&#xA;KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED&#xA;TO, THE&#xA;IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#xA;PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF&#xA;THE&#xA;LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU&#xA;ASSUME&#xA;THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO&#xA;IN&#xA;WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY&#xA;MODIFY&#xA;AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE&#xA;TO YOU&#xA;FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR&#xA;CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO&#xA;USE THE&#xA;LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING&#xA;RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES&#xA;OR A&#xA;FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN&#xA;IF&#xA;SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY&#xA;OF SUCH&#xA;DAMAGES.&#xA;END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries&#xA;If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest&#xA;possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software&#xA;that&#xA;everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting&#xA;redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the&#xA;terms of the&#xA;ordinary General Public License).&#xA;To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.&#xA;It is&#xA;safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most&#xA;effectively&#xA;convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at&#xA;least the&#xA;&quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.&#xA;&lt;one line to give the library&apos;s name and a brief idea of what&#xA;it does.&gt;&#xA;Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;&#xA;This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or&#xA;modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either&#xA;version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.&#xA;This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,&#xA;but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of&#xA;MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the&#xA;GNU&#xA;Lesser General Public License for more details.&#xA;You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software&#xA;Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307&#xA;USA&#xA;Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and&#xA;paper mail.&#xA;You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer)&#xA;or your&#xA;school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the library,&#xA;if&#xA;necessary.

        GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;Version 2.1, February 1999&#xA;Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.&#xA;59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA&#xA;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies&#xA;of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.&#xA;[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also&#xA;counts&#xA;as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2,&#xA;hence&#xA;the version number 2.1.]&#xA;Preamble&#xA;The licenses for most software are designed to take away your&#xA;freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General&#xA;Public&#xA;Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and&#xA;change&#xA;free software--to make sure the software is free for all its&#xA;users.&#xA;This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some&#xA;specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of&#xA;the&#xA;Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use&#xA;it.  You&#xA;can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about&#xA;whether&#xA;this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better&#xA;strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations&#xA;below.&#xA;When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of&#xA;use,&#xA;not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make&#xA;sure that&#xA;you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and&#xA;charge&#xA;for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or&#xA;can get&#xA;it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces&#xA;of&#xA;it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can&#xA;do&#xA;these things.&#xA;To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid&#xA;distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender&#xA;these&#xA;rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities&#xA;for&#xA;you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify&#xA;it.&#xA;For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether&#xA;gratis&#xA;or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that&#xA;we gave&#xA;you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the&#xA;source&#xA;code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide&#xA;complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink&#xA;them&#xA;with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling&#xA;it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.&#xA;We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright&#xA;the&#xA;library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal&#xA;permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.&#xA;To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that&#xA;there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library&#xA;is&#xA;modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should&#xA;know&#xA;that what they have is not the original version, so that the&#xA;original&#xA;author&apos;s reputation will not be affected by problems that might&#xA;be&#xA;introduced by others.&#xA;Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence&#xA;of&#xA;any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot&#xA;effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining&#xA;a&#xA;restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist&#xA;that&#xA;any patent license obtained for a version of the library must&#xA;be&#xA;consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.&#xA;Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the&#xA;ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser&#xA;General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries,&#xA;and&#xA;is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.&#xA;We use&#xA;this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking&#xA;those&#xA;libraries into non-free programs.&#xA;When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or&#xA;using&#xA;a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking&#xA;a&#xA;combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary&#xA;General Public License therefore permits such linking only if&#xA;the&#xA;entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser&#xA;General&#xA;Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code&#xA;with&#xA;the library.&#xA;We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because&#xA;it&#xA;does Less to protect the user&apos;s freedom than the ordinary General&#xA;Public License.  It also provides other free software developers&#xA;Less&#xA;of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages&#xA;are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for&#xA;many&#xA;libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in&#xA;certain&#xA;special circumstances.&#xA;For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to&#xA;encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that&#xA;it becomes&#xA;a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must&#xA;be&#xA;allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free&#xA;library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.&#xA;In this&#xA;case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to&#xA;free&#xA;software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.&#xA;In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free&#xA;programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body&#xA;of&#xA;free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library&#xA;in&#xA;non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU&#xA;operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating&#xA;system.&#xA;Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective&#xA;of the&#xA;users&apos; freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that&#xA;is&#xA;linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to&#xA;run&#xA;that program using a modified version of the Library.&#xA;The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between&#xA;a&#xA;&quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;.&#xA;The&#xA;former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter&#xA;must&#xA;be combined with the library in order to run.&#xA;GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION&#xA;0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or&#xA;other&#xA;program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder&#xA;or&#xA;other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the&#xA;terms of&#xA;this Lesser General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;).&#xA;Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.&#xA;A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data&#xA;prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs&#xA;(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.&#xA;The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or&#xA;work&#xA;which has been distributed under these terms.  A &quot;work based&#xA;on the&#xA;Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under&#xA;copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library&#xA;or a&#xA;portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated&#xA;straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation&#xA;is&#xA;included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)&#xA;&quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work&#xA;for&#xA;making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code&#xA;means&#xA;all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated&#xA;interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control&#xA;compilation&#xA;and installation of the library.&#xA;Activities other than copying, distribution and modification&#xA;are not&#xA;covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act&#xA;of&#xA;running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output&#xA;from&#xA;such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work&#xA;based&#xA;on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool&#xA;for&#xA;writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library&#xA;does&#xA;and what the program that uses the Library does.&#xA;1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library&apos;s&#xA;complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided&#xA;that&#xA;you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an&#xA;appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep&#xA;intact&#xA;all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence&#xA;of any&#xA;warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the&#xA;Library.&#xA;You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,&#xA;and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange&#xA;for a&#xA;fee.&#xA;2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion&#xA;of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and&#xA;distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section&#xA;1&#xA;above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;a) The modified work must itself be a software library.&#xA;b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices&#xA;stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.&#xA;c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no&#xA;charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.&#xA;d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function&#xA;or a&#xA;table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses&#xA;the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility&#xA;is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure&#xA;that,&#xA;in the event an application does not supply such function or&#xA;table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part&#xA;of&#xA;its purpose remains meaningful.&#xA;(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots&#xA;has&#xA;a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the&#xA;application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any&#xA;application-supplied function or table used by this function&#xA;must&#xA;be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square&#xA;root function must still compute square roots.)&#xA;These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If&#xA;identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,&#xA;and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works&#xA;in&#xA;themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to&#xA;those&#xA;sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when&#xA;you&#xA;distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work&#xA;based&#xA;on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the&#xA;terms of&#xA;this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to&#xA;the&#xA;entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who&#xA;wrote&#xA;it.&#xA;Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or&#xA;contest&#xA;your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent&#xA;is to&#xA;exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative&#xA;or&#xA;collective works based on the Library.&#xA;In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the&#xA;Library&#xA;with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume&#xA;of&#xA;a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work&#xA;under&#xA;the scope of this License.&#xA;3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General&#xA;Public&#xA;License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.&#xA;To do&#xA;this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License,&#xA;so&#xA;that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version&#xA;2,&#xA;instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version&#xA;2 of the&#xA;ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can&#xA;specify&#xA;that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change&#xA;in&#xA;these notices.&#xA;Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible&#xA;for&#xA;that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies&#xA;to all&#xA;subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.&#xA;This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code&#xA;of&#xA;the Library into a program that is not a library.&#xA;4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or&#xA;derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable&#xA;form&#xA;under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany&#xA;it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code,&#xA;which&#xA;must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above&#xA;on a&#xA;medium customarily used for software interchange.&#xA;If distribution of object code is made by offering access to&#xA;copy&#xA;from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy&#xA;the&#xA;source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to&#xA;distribute the source code, even though third parties are not&#xA;compelled to copy the source along with the object code.&#xA;5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the&#xA;Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled&#xA;or&#xA;linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;.  Such&#xA;a&#xA;work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library,&#xA;and&#xA;therefore falls outside the scope of this License.&#xA;However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library&#xA;creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because&#xA;it&#xA;contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses&#xA;the&#xA;library&quot;.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.&#xA;Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.&#xA;When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header&#xA;file&#xA;that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may&#xA;be a&#xA;derivative work of the Library even though the source code is&#xA;not.&#xA;Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can&#xA;be&#xA;linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.&#xA;The&#xA;threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.&#xA;If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data&#xA;structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline&#xA;functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the&#xA;object&#xA;file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative&#xA;work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions&#xA;of the&#xA;Library will still fall under Section 6.)&#xA;Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may&#xA;distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section&#xA;6.&#xA;Any executables containing that work also fall under Section&#xA;6,&#xA;whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.&#xA;6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine&#xA;or&#xA;link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce&#xA;a&#xA;work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that&#xA;work&#xA;under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit&#xA;modification of the work for the customer&apos;s own use and reverse&#xA;engineering for debugging such modifications.&#xA;You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that&#xA;the&#xA;Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered&#xA;by&#xA;this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the&#xA;work&#xA;during execution displays copyright notices, you must include&#xA;the&#xA;copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference&#xA;directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must&#xA;do one&#xA;of these things:&#xA;a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding&#xA;machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever&#xA;changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under&#xA;Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked&#xA;with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that&#xA;uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that&#xA;the&#xA;user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified&#xA;executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood&#xA;that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in&#xA;the&#xA;Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application&#xA;to use the modified definitions.)&#xA;b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the&#xA;Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time&#xA;a&#xA;copy of the library already present on the user&apos;s computer system,&#xA;rather than copying library functions into the executable, and&#xA;(2)&#xA;will operate properly with a modified version of the library,&#xA;if&#xA;the user installs one, as long as the modified version is&#xA;interface-compatible with the version that the work was made&#xA;with.&#xA;c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at&#xA;least three years, to give the same user the materials&#xA;specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more&#xA;than the cost of performing this distribution.&#xA;d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to&#xA;copy&#xA;from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the&#xA;above&#xA;specified materials from the same place.&#xA;e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these&#xA;materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.&#xA;For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the&#xA;Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for&#xA;reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,&#xA;the materials to be distributed need not include anything that&#xA;is&#xA;normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the&#xA;major&#xA;components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system&#xA;on&#xA;which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies&#xA;the executable.&#xA;It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license&#xA;restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally&#xA;accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you&#xA;cannot&#xA;use both them and the Library together in an executable that&#xA;you&#xA;distribute.&#xA;7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on&#xA;the&#xA;Library side-by-side in a single library together with other&#xA;library&#xA;facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a&#xA;combined&#xA;library, provided that the separate distribution of the work&#xA;based on&#xA;the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise&#xA;permitted, and provided that you do these two things:&#xA;a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work&#xA;based on the Library, uncombined with any other library&#xA;facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the&#xA;Sections above.&#xA;b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact&#xA;that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining&#xA;where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.&#xA;8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute&#xA;the Library except as expressly provided under this License.&#xA;Any&#xA;attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or&#xA;distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate&#xA;your&#xA;rights under this License.  However, parties who have received&#xA;copies,&#xA;or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses&#xA;terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.&#xA;9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have&#xA;not&#xA;signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify&#xA;or&#xA;distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions&#xA;are&#xA;prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore,&#xA;by&#xA;modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the&#xA;Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do&#xA;so, and&#xA;all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying&#xA;the Library or works based on it.&#xA;10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based&#xA;on the&#xA;Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from&#xA;the&#xA;original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the&#xA;Library&#xA;subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any&#xA;further&#xA;restrictions on the recipients&apos; exercise of the rights granted&#xA;herein.&#xA;You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties&#xA;with&#xA;this License.&#xA;11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of&#xA;patent&#xA;infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),&#xA;conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement&#xA;or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they&#xA;do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot&#xA;distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under&#xA;this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence&#xA;you&#xA;may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent&#xA;license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library&#xA;by&#xA;all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you,&#xA;then&#xA;the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would&#xA;be to&#xA;refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.&#xA;If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable&#xA;under any&#xA;particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended&#xA;to apply,&#xA;and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.&#xA;It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe&#xA;any&#xA;patents or other property right claims or to contest validity&#xA;of any&#xA;such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting&#xA;the&#xA;integrity of the free software distribution system which is&#xA;implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made&#xA;generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed&#xA;through that system in reliance on consistent application of&#xA;that&#xA;system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is&#xA;willing&#xA;to distribute software through any other system and a licensee&#xA;cannot&#xA;impose that choice.&#xA;This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed&#xA;to&#xA;be a consequence of the rest of this License.&#xA;12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted&#xA;in&#xA;certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,&#xA;the&#xA;original copyright holder who places the Library under this License&#xA;may add&#xA;an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those&#xA;countries,&#xA;so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries&#xA;not thus&#xA;excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation&#xA;as if&#xA;written in the body of this License.&#xA;13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new&#xA;versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.&#xA;Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,&#xA;but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.&#xA;Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&#xA;Library&#xA;specifies a version number of this License which applies to it&#xA;and&#xA;&quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms&#xA;and&#xA;conditions either of that version or of any later version published&#xA;by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify&#xA;a&#xA;license version number, you may choose any version ever published&#xA;by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation.&#xA;14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other&#xA;free&#xA;programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with&#xA;these,&#xA;write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which&#xA;is&#xA;copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free&#xA;Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. &#xA;Our&#xA;decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free&#xA;status&#xA;of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the&#xA;sharing&#xA;and reuse of software generally.&#xA;NO WARRANTY&#xA;15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS&#xA;NO&#xA;WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE&#xA;LAW.&#xA;EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS&#xA;AND/OR&#xA;OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF&#xA;ANY&#xA;KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED&#xA;TO, THE&#xA;IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#xA;PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF&#xA;THE&#xA;LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU&#xA;ASSUME&#xA;THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO&#xA;IN&#xA;WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY&#xA;MODIFY&#xA;AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE&#xA;TO YOU&#xA;FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR&#xA;CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO&#xA;USE THE&#xA;LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING&#xA;RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES&#xA;OR A&#xA;FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN&#xA;IF&#xA;SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY&#xA;OF SUCH&#xA;DAMAGES.&#xA;END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries&#xA;If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest&#xA;possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software&#xA;that&#xA;everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting&#xA;redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the&#xA;terms of the&#xA;ordinary General Public License).&#xA;To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.&#xA;It is&#xA;safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most&#xA;effectively&#xA;convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at&#xA;least the&#xA;&quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.&#xA;&lt;one line to give the library&apos;s name and a brief idea of what&#xA;it does.&gt;&#xA;Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;&#xA;This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or&#xA;modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either&#xA;version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.&#xA;This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,&#xA;but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of&#xA;MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the&#xA;GNU&#xA;Lesser General Public License for more details.&#xA;You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software&#xA;Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307&#xA;USA&#xA;Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and&#xA;paper mail.&#xA;You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer)&#xA;or your&#xA;school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the library,&#xA;if&#xA;necessary.

          GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;Version 2.1, February 1999&#xA;Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.&#xA;59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA&#xA;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies&#xA;of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.&#xA;[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also&#xA;counts&#xA;as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2,&#xA;hence&#xA;the version number 2.1.]&#xA;Preamble&#xA;The licenses for most software are designed to take away your&#xA;freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General&#xA;Public&#xA;Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and&#xA;change&#xA;free software--to make sure the software is free for all its&#xA;users.&#xA;This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some&#xA;specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of&#xA;the&#xA;Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use&#xA;it.  You&#xA;can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about&#xA;whether&#xA;this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better&#xA;strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations&#xA;below.&#xA;When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of&#xA;use,&#xA;not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make&#xA;sure that&#xA;you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and&#xA;charge&#xA;for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or&#xA;can get&#xA;it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces&#xA;of&#xA;it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can&#xA;do&#xA;these things.&#xA;To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid&#xA;distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender&#xA;these&#xA;rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities&#xA;for&#xA;you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify&#xA;it.&#xA;For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether&#xA;gratis&#xA;or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that&#xA;we gave&#xA;you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the&#xA;source&#xA;code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide&#xA;complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink&#xA;them&#xA;with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling&#xA;it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.&#xA;We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright&#xA;the&#xA;library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal&#xA;permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.&#xA;To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that&#xA;there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library&#xA;is&#xA;modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should&#xA;know&#xA;that what they have is not the original version, so that the&#xA;original&#xA;author&apos;s reputation will not be affected by problems that might&#xA;be&#xA;introduced by others.&#xA;Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence&#xA;of&#xA;any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot&#xA;effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining&#xA;a&#xA;restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist&#xA;that&#xA;any patent license obtained for a version of the library must&#xA;be&#xA;consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.&#xA;Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the&#xA;ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser&#xA;General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries,&#xA;and&#xA;is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.&#xA;We use&#xA;this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking&#xA;those&#xA;libraries into non-free programs.&#xA;When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or&#xA;using&#xA;a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking&#xA;a&#xA;combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary&#xA;General Public License therefore permits such linking only if&#xA;the&#xA;entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser&#xA;General&#xA;Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code&#xA;with&#xA;the library.&#xA;We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because&#xA;it&#xA;does Less to protect the user&apos;s freedom than the ordinary General&#xA;Public License.  It also provides other free software developers&#xA;Less&#xA;of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages&#xA;are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for&#xA;many&#xA;libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in&#xA;certain&#xA;special circumstances.&#xA;For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to&#xA;encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that&#xA;it becomes&#xA;a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must&#xA;be&#xA;allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free&#xA;library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.&#xA;In this&#xA;case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to&#xA;free&#xA;software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.&#xA;In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free&#xA;programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body&#xA;of&#xA;free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library&#xA;in&#xA;non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU&#xA;operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating&#xA;system.&#xA;Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective&#xA;of the&#xA;users&apos; freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that&#xA;is&#xA;linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to&#xA;run&#xA;that program using a modified version of the Library.&#xA;The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between&#xA;a&#xA;&quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;.&#xA;The&#xA;former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter&#xA;must&#xA;be combined with the library in order to run.&#xA;GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION&#xA;0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or&#xA;other&#xA;program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder&#xA;or&#xA;other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the&#xA;terms of&#xA;this Lesser General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;).&#xA;Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.&#xA;A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data&#xA;prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs&#xA;(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.&#xA;The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or&#xA;work&#xA;which has been distributed under these terms.  A &quot;work based&#xA;on the&#xA;Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under&#xA;copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library&#xA;or a&#xA;portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated&#xA;straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation&#xA;is&#xA;included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)&#xA;&quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work&#xA;for&#xA;making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code&#xA;means&#xA;all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated&#xA;interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control&#xA;compilation&#xA;and installation of the library.&#xA;Activities other than copying, distribution and modification&#xA;are not&#xA;covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act&#xA;of&#xA;running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output&#xA;from&#xA;such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work&#xA;based&#xA;on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool&#xA;for&#xA;writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library&#xA;does&#xA;and what the program that uses the Library does.&#xA;1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library&apos;s&#xA;complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided&#xA;that&#xA;you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an&#xA;appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep&#xA;intact&#xA;all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence&#xA;of any&#xA;warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the&#xA;Library.&#xA;You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,&#xA;and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange&#xA;for a&#xA;fee.&#xA;2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion&#xA;of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and&#xA;distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section&#xA;1&#xA;above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;a) The modified work must itself be a software library.&#xA;b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices&#xA;stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.&#xA;c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no&#xA;charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.&#xA;d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function&#xA;or a&#xA;table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses&#xA;the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility&#xA;is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure&#xA;that,&#xA;in the event an application does not supply such function or&#xA;table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part&#xA;of&#xA;its purpose remains meaningful.&#xA;(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots&#xA;has&#xA;a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the&#xA;application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any&#xA;application-supplied function or table used by this function&#xA;must&#xA;be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square&#xA;root function must still compute square roots.)&#xA;These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If&#xA;identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,&#xA;and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works&#xA;in&#xA;themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to&#xA;those&#xA;sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when&#xA;you&#xA;distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work&#xA;based&#xA;on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the&#xA;terms of&#xA;this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to&#xA;the&#xA;entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who&#xA;wrote&#xA;it.&#xA;Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or&#xA;contest&#xA;your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent&#xA;is to&#xA;exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative&#xA;or&#xA;collective works based on the Library.&#xA;In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the&#xA;Library&#xA;with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume&#xA;of&#xA;a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work&#xA;under&#xA;the scope of this License.&#xA;3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General&#xA;Public&#xA;License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.&#xA;To do&#xA;this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License,&#xA;so&#xA;that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version&#xA;2,&#xA;instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version&#xA;2 of the&#xA;ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can&#xA;specify&#xA;that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change&#xA;in&#xA;these notices.&#xA;Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible&#xA;for&#xA;that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies&#xA;to all&#xA;subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.&#xA;This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code&#xA;of&#xA;the Library into a program that is not a library.&#xA;4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or&#xA;derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable&#xA;form&#xA;under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany&#xA;it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code,&#xA;which&#xA;must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above&#xA;on a&#xA;medium customarily used for software interchange.&#xA;If distribution of object code is made by offering access to&#xA;copy&#xA;from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy&#xA;the&#xA;source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to&#xA;distribute the source code, even though third parties are not&#xA;compelled to copy the source along with the object code.&#xA;5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the&#xA;Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled&#xA;or&#xA;linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;.  Such&#xA;a&#xA;work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library,&#xA;and&#xA;therefore falls outside the scope of this License.&#xA;However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library&#xA;creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because&#xA;it&#xA;contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses&#xA;the&#xA;library&quot;.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.&#xA;Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.&#xA;When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header&#xA;file&#xA;that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may&#xA;be a&#xA;derivative work of the Library even though the source code is&#xA;not.&#xA;Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can&#xA;be&#xA;linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.&#xA;The&#xA;threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.&#xA;If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data&#xA;structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline&#xA;functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the&#xA;object&#xA;file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative&#xA;work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions&#xA;of the&#xA;Library will still fall under Section 6.)&#xA;Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may&#xA;distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section&#xA;6.&#xA;Any executables containing that work also fall under Section&#xA;6,&#xA;whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.&#xA;6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine&#xA;or&#xA;link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce&#xA;a&#xA;work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that&#xA;work&#xA;under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit&#xA;modification of the work for the customer&apos;s own use and reverse&#xA;engineering for debugging such modifications.&#xA;You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that&#xA;the&#xA;Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered&#xA;by&#xA;this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the&#xA;work&#xA;during execution displays copyright notices, you must include&#xA;the&#xA;copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference&#xA;directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must&#xA;do one&#xA;of these things:&#xA;a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding&#xA;machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever&#xA;changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under&#xA;Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked&#xA;with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that&#xA;uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that&#xA;the&#xA;user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified&#xA;executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood&#xA;that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in&#xA;the&#xA;Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application&#xA;to use the modified definitions.)&#xA;b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the&#xA;Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time&#xA;a&#xA;copy of the library already present on the user&apos;s computer system,&#xA;rather than copying library functions into the executable, and&#xA;(2)&#xA;will operate properly with a modified version of the library,&#xA;if&#xA;the user installs one, as long as the modified version is&#xA;interface-compatible with the version that the work was made&#xA;with.&#xA;c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at&#xA;least three years, to give the same user the materials&#xA;specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more&#xA;than the cost of performing this distribution.&#xA;d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to&#xA;copy&#xA;from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the&#xA;above&#xA;specified materials from the same place.&#xA;e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these&#xA;materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.&#xA;For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the&#xA;Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for&#xA;reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,&#xA;the materials to be distributed need not include anything that&#xA;is&#xA;normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the&#xA;major&#xA;components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system&#xA;on&#xA;which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies&#xA;the executable.&#xA;It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license&#xA;restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally&#xA;accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you&#xA;cannot&#xA;use both them and the Library together in an executable that&#xA;you&#xA;distribute.&#xA;7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on&#xA;the&#xA;Library side-by-side in a single library together with other&#xA;library&#xA;facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a&#xA;combined&#xA;library, provided that the separate distribution of the work&#xA;based on&#xA;the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise&#xA;permitted, and provided that you do these two things:&#xA;a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work&#xA;based on the Library, uncombined with any other library&#xA;facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the&#xA;Sections above.&#xA;b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact&#xA;that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining&#xA;where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.&#xA;8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute&#xA;the Library except as expressly provided under this License.&#xA;Any&#xA;attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or&#xA;distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate&#xA;your&#xA;rights under this License.  However, parties who have received&#xA;copies,&#xA;or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses&#xA;terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.&#xA;9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have&#xA;not&#xA;signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify&#xA;or&#xA;distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions&#xA;are&#xA;prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore,&#xA;by&#xA;modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the&#xA;Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do&#xA;so, and&#xA;all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying&#xA;the Library or works based on it.&#xA;10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based&#xA;on the&#xA;Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from&#xA;the&#xA;original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the&#xA;Library&#xA;subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any&#xA;further&#xA;restrictions on the recipients&apos; exercise of the rights granted&#xA;herein.&#xA;You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties&#xA;with&#xA;this License.&#xA;11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of&#xA;patent&#xA;infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),&#xA;conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement&#xA;or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they&#xA;do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot&#xA;distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under&#xA;this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence&#xA;you&#xA;may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent&#xA;license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library&#xA;by&#xA;all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you,&#xA;then&#xA;the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would&#xA;be to&#xA;refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.&#xA;If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable&#xA;under any&#xA;particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended&#xA;to apply,&#xA;and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.&#xA;It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe&#xA;any&#xA;patents or other property right claims or to contest validity&#xA;of any&#xA;such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting&#xA;the&#xA;integrity of the free software distribution system which is&#xA;implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made&#xA;generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed&#xA;through that system in reliance on consistent application of&#xA;that&#xA;system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is&#xA;willing&#xA;to distribute software through any other system and a licensee&#xA;cannot&#xA;impose that choice.&#xA;This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed&#xA;to&#xA;be a consequence of the rest of this License.&#xA;12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted&#xA;in&#xA;certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,&#xA;the&#xA;original copyright holder who places the Library under this License&#xA;may add&#xA;an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those&#xA;countries,&#xA;so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries&#xA;not thus&#xA;excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation&#xA;as if&#xA;written in the body of this License.&#xA;13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new&#xA;versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.&#xA;Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,&#xA;but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.&#xA;Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&#xA;Library&#xA;specifies a version number of this License which applies to it&#xA;and&#xA;&quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms&#xA;and&#xA;conditions either of that version or of any later version published&#xA;by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify&#xA;a&#xA;license version number, you may choose any version ever published&#xA;by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation.&#xA;14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other&#xA;free&#xA;programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with&#xA;these,&#xA;write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which&#xA;is&#xA;copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free&#xA;Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. &#xA;Our&#xA;decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free&#xA;status&#xA;of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the&#xA;sharing&#xA;and reuse of software generally.&#xA;NO WARRANTY&#xA;15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS&#xA;NO&#xA;WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE&#xA;LAW.&#xA;EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS&#xA;AND/OR&#xA;OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF&#xA;ANY&#xA;KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED&#xA;TO, THE&#xA;IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#xA;PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF&#xA;THE&#xA;LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU&#xA;ASSUME&#xA;THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO&#xA;IN&#xA;WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY&#xA;MODIFY&#xA;AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE&#xA;TO YOU&#xA;FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR&#xA;CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO&#xA;USE THE&#xA;LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING&#xA;RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES&#xA;OR A&#xA;FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN&#xA;IF&#xA;SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY&#xA;OF SUCH&#xA;DAMAGES.&#xA;END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries&#xA;If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest&#xA;possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software&#xA;that&#xA;everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting&#xA;redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the&#xA;terms of the&#xA;ordinary General Public License).&#xA;To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.&#xA;It is&#xA;safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most&#xA;effectively&#xA;convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at&#xA;least the&#xA;&quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.&#xA;&lt;one line to give the library&apos;s name and a brief idea of what&#xA;it does.&gt;&#xA;Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;&#xA;This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or&#xA;modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either&#xA;version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.&#xA;This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,&#xA;but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of&#xA;MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the&#xA;GNU&#xA;Lesser General Public License for more details.&#xA;You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software&#xA;Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307&#xA;USA&#xA;Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and&#xA;paper mail.&#xA;You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer)&#xA;or your&#xA;school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the library,&#xA;if&#xA;necessary.

          GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;         Version 2.1, February 1999&#xA;&#xA; Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.&#xA;     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA&#xA; Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies&#xA; of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.&#xA;&#xA;[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts&#xA; as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence&#xA; the version number 2.1.]&#xA;&#xA;       Preamble&#xA;&#xA;  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your&#xA;freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public&#xA;Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change&#xA;free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.&#xA;&#xA;  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some&#xA;specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the&#xA;Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You&#xA;can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether&#xA;this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better&#xA;strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.&#xA;&#xA;  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,&#xA;not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that&#xA;you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge&#xA;for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get&#xA;it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of&#xA;it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do&#xA;these things.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid&#xA;distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these&#xA;rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for&#xA;you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis&#xA;or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave&#xA;you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source&#xA;code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide&#xA;complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them&#xA;with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling&#xA;it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.&#xA;&#xA;  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the&#xA;library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal&#xA;permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that&#xA;there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is&#xA;modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know&#xA;that what they have is not the original version, so that the original&#xA;author&apos;s reputation will not be affected by problems that might be&#xA;introduced by others.&#xA;&#xA;  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of&#xA;any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot&#xA;effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a&#xA;restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that&#xA;any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be&#xA;consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.&#xA;&#xA;  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the&#xA;ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser&#xA;General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and&#xA;is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use&#xA;this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those&#xA;libraries into non-free programs.&#xA;&#xA;  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using&#xA;a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a&#xA;combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary&#xA;General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the&#xA;entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General&#xA;Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with&#xA;the library.&#xA;&#xA;  We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because it&#xA;does Less to protect the user&apos;s freedom than the ordinary General&#xA;Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less&#xA;of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages&#xA;are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many&#xA;libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain&#xA;special circumstances.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to&#xA;encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes&#xA;a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be&#xA;allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free&#xA;library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this&#xA;case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free&#xA;software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free&#xA;programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of&#xA;free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in&#xA;non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU&#xA;operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating&#xA;system.&#xA;&#xA;  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the&#xA;users&apos; freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is&#xA;linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run&#xA;that program using a modified version of the Library.&#xA;&#xA;  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a&#xA;&quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;.  The&#xA;former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must&#xA;be combined with the library in order to run.&#xA;&#xA;    GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION&#xA;&#xA;  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other&#xA;program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or&#xA;other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of&#xA;this Lesser General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;).&#xA;Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data&#xA;prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs&#xA;(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work&#xA;which has been distributed under these terms.  A &quot;work based on the&#xA;Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under&#xA;copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a&#xA;portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated&#xA;straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is&#xA;included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for&#xA;making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means&#xA;all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated&#xA;interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation&#xA;and installation of the library.&#xA;&#xA;  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not&#xA;covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of&#xA;running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from&#xA;such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based&#xA;on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for&#xA;writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does&#xA;and what the program that uses the Library does.&#xA;  &#xA;  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library&apos;s&#xA;complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that&#xA;you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an&#xA;appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact&#xA;all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any&#xA;warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the&#xA;Library.&#xA;&#xA;  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,&#xA;and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a&#xA;fee.&#xA;&#xA;  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion&#xA;of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and&#xA;distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1&#xA;above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;&#xA;    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.&#xA;&#xA;    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices&#xA;    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.&#xA;&#xA;    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no&#xA;    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.&#xA;&#xA;    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a&#xA;    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses&#xA;    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility&#xA;    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,&#xA;    in the event an application does not supply such function or&#xA;    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of&#xA;    its purpose remains meaningful.&#xA;&#xA;    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has&#xA;    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the&#xA;    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any&#xA;    application-supplied function or table used by this function must&#xA;    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square&#xA;    root function must still compute square roots.)&#xA;&#xA;These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If&#xA;identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,&#xA;and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in&#xA;themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those&#xA;sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you&#xA;distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based&#xA;on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of&#xA;this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the&#xA;entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote&#xA;it.&#xA;&#xA;Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest&#xA;your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to&#xA;exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or&#xA;collective works based on the Library.&#xA;&#xA;In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library&#xA;with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of&#xA;a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under&#xA;the scope of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public&#xA;License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do&#xA;this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so&#xA;that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,&#xA;instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the&#xA;ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify&#xA;that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in&#xA;these notices.&#xA;&#xA;  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for&#xA;that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all&#xA;subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.&#xA;&#xA;  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of&#xA;the Library into a program that is not a library.&#xA;&#xA;  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or&#xA;derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form&#xA;under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany&#xA;it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which&#xA;must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a&#xA;medium customarily used for software interchange.&#xA;&#xA;  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy&#xA;from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the&#xA;source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to&#xA;distribute the source code, even though third parties are not&#xA;compelled to copy the source along with the object code.&#xA;&#xA;  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the&#xA;Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or&#xA;linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;.  Such a&#xA;work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and&#xA;therefore falls outside the scope of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library&#xA;creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it&#xA;contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses the&#xA;library&quot;.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.&#xA;Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.&#xA;&#xA;  When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header file&#xA;that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a&#xA;derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.&#xA;Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be&#xA;linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The&#xA;threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.&#xA;&#xA;  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data&#xA;structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline&#xA;functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object&#xA;file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative&#xA;work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the&#xA;Library will still fall under Section 6.)&#xA;&#xA;  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may&#xA;distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.&#xA;Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,&#xA;whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.&#xA;&#xA;  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or&#xA;link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce a&#xA;work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work&#xA;under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit&#xA;modification of the work for the customer&apos;s own use and reverse&#xA;engineering for debugging such modifications.&#xA;&#xA;  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the&#xA;Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by&#xA;this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work&#xA;during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the&#xA;copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference&#xA;directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one&#xA;of these things:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding&#xA;    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever&#xA;    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under&#xA;    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked&#xA;    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that&#xA;    uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that the&#xA;    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified&#xA;    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood&#xA;    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the&#xA;    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application&#xA;    to use the modified definitions.)&#xA;&#xA;    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the&#xA;    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a&#xA;    copy of the library already present on the user&apos;s computer system,&#xA;    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)&#xA;    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if&#xA;    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is&#xA;    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.&#xA;&#xA;    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at&#xA;    least three years, to give the same user the materials&#xA;    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more&#xA;    than the cost of performing this distribution.&#xA;&#xA;    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy&#xA;    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above&#xA;    specified materials from the same place.&#xA;&#xA;    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these&#xA;    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.&#xA;&#xA;  For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the&#xA;Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for&#xA;reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,&#xA;the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is&#xA;normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major&#xA;components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on&#xA;which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies&#xA;the executable.&#xA;&#xA;  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license&#xA;restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally&#xA;accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot&#xA;use both them and the Library together in an executable that you&#xA;distribute.&#xA;&#xA;  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the&#xA;Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library&#xA;facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined&#xA;library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on&#xA;the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise&#xA;permitted, and provided that you do these two things:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work&#xA;    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library&#xA;    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the&#xA;    Sections above.&#xA;&#xA;    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact&#xA;    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining&#xA;    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.&#xA;&#xA;  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute&#xA;the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any&#xA;attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or&#xA;distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your&#xA;rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,&#xA;or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses&#xA;terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.&#xA;&#xA;  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not&#xA;signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or&#xA;distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are&#xA;prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by&#xA;modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the&#xA;Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and&#xA;all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying&#xA;the Library or works based on it.&#xA;&#xA;  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the&#xA;Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the&#xA;original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library&#xA;subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further&#xA;restrictions on the recipients&apos; exercise of the rights granted herein.&#xA;You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with&#xA;this License.&#xA;&#xA;  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent&#xA;infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),&#xA;conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot&#xA;distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you&#xA;may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent&#xA;license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by&#xA;all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then&#xA;the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to&#xA;refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.&#xA;&#xA;If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any&#xA;particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,&#xA;and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.&#xA;&#xA;It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any&#xA;patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any&#xA;such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the&#xA;integrity of the free software distribution system which is&#xA;implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made&#xA;generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed&#xA;through that system in reliance on consistent application of that&#xA;system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing&#xA;to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot&#xA;impose that choice.&#xA;&#xA;This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to&#xA;be a consequence of the rest of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in&#xA;certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the&#xA;original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add&#xA;an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,&#xA;so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus&#xA;excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if&#xA;written in the body of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new&#xA;versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.&#xA;Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,&#xA;but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.&#xA;&#xA;Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library&#xA;specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and&#xA;&quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and&#xA;conditions either of that version or of any later version published by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a&#xA;license version number, you may choose any version ever published by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation.&#xA;&#xA;  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free&#xA;programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,&#xA;write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is&#xA;copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free&#xA;Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our&#xA;decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status&#xA;of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing&#xA;and reuse of software generally.&#xA;&#xA;       NO WARRANTY&#xA;&#xA;  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO&#xA;WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.&#xA;EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR&#xA;OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY&#xA;KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE&#xA;IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#xA;PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE&#xA;LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME&#xA;THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;&#xA;  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN&#xA;WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY&#xA;AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU&#xA;FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR&#xA;CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE&#xA;LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING&#xA;RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A&#xA;FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF&#xA;SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH&#xA;DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;       END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;&#xA;           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries&#xA;&#xA;  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest&#xA;possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that&#xA;everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting&#xA;redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the&#xA;ordinary General Public License).&#xA;&#xA;  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is&#xA;safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively&#xA;convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the&#xA;&quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.&#xA;&#xA;    &lt;one line to give the library&apos;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;&#xA;    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;&#xA;&#xA;    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or&#xA;    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either&#xA;    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.&#xA;&#xA;    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,&#xA;    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of&#xA;    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU&#xA;    Lesser General Public License for more details.&#xA;&#xA;    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software&#xA;    Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA&#xA;&#xA;Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.&#xA;&#xA;You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your&#xA;school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the library, if&#xA;necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:&#xA;&#xA;  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the&#xA;  library `Frob&apos; (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.&#xA;&#xA;  &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1990&#xA;  Ty Coon, President of Vice&#xA;&#xA;That&apos;s all there is to it!

          GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 2.1, February 1999&#xA;&#xA;  Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 59&#xA;  Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA Everyone is&#xA;  permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license&#xA;  document, but changing it is not allowed.&#xA;&#xA;  [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also&#xA;  counts as the successor of the GNU Library Public License,&#xA;  version 2, hence the version number 2.1.]&#xA;&#xA;  Preamble&#xA;&#xA;  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your&#xA;  freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General&#xA;  Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share&#xA;  and change free software--to make sure the software is free for&#xA;  all its users.&#xA;&#xA;  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some&#xA;  specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of&#xA;  the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use&#xA;  it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully&#xA;  about whether this license or the ordinary General Public&#xA;  License is the better strategy to use in any particular case,&#xA;  based on the explanations below.&#xA;&#xA;  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of&#xA;  use, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make&#xA;  sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free&#xA;  software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you&#xA;  receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can&#xA;  change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs;&#xA;  and that you are informed that you can do these things.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid&#xA;  distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender&#xA;  these rights. These restrictions translate to certain&#xA;  responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library&#xA;  or if you modify it.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether&#xA;  gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights&#xA;  that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or&#xA;  can get the source code. If you link other code with the&#xA;  library, you must provide complete object files to the&#xA;  recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after&#xA;  making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must&#xA;  show them these terms so they know their rights.&#xA;&#xA;  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright&#xA;  the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you&#xA;  legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that&#xA;  there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library&#xA;  is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should&#xA;  know that what they have is not the original version, so that&#xA;  the original author&apos;s reputation will not be affected by&#xA;  problems that might be introduced by others.&#xA;&#xA;  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the&#xA;  existence of any free program. We wish to make sure that a&#xA;  company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program&#xA;  by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder.&#xA;  Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a&#xA;  version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom&#xA;  of use specified in this license.&#xA;&#xA;  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the&#xA;  ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU&#xA;  Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated&#xA;  libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General&#xA;  Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in&#xA;  order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.&#xA;&#xA;  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or&#xA;  using a shared library, the combination of the two is legally&#xA;  speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library.&#xA;  The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such&#xA;  linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of&#xA;  freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax&#xA;  criteria for linking other code with the library.&#xA;&#xA;  We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public&#xA;  License because it does Less to protect the user&apos;s freedom&#xA;  than the ordinary General Public License. It also provides other&#xA;  free software developers Less of an advantage over competing&#xA;  non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the&#xA;  ordinary General Public License for many libraries. However, the&#xA;  Lesser license provides advantages in certain special&#xA;  circumstances.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to&#xA;  encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that&#xA;  it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free&#xA;  programs must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent&#xA;  case is that a free library does the same job as widely used&#xA;  non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by&#xA;  limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the&#xA;  Lesser General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in&#xA;  non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a&#xA;  large body of free software. For example, permission to use the&#xA;  GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to&#xA;  use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the&#xA;  GNU/Linux operating system.&#xA;&#xA;  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of&#xA;  the users&apos; freedom, it does ensure that the user of a&#xA;  program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the&#xA;  wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the&#xA;  Library.&#xA;&#xA;  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;  modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference&#xA;  between a &quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work&#xA;  that uses the library&quot;. The former contains code derived&#xA;  from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the&#xA;  library in order to run.&#xA;&#xA;  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR&#xA;  COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION&#xA;&#xA;  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or&#xA;  other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright&#xA;  holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed&#xA;  under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also&#xA;  called &quot;this License&quot;). Each licensee is addressed as&#xA;  &quot;you&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions&#xA;  and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with&#xA;  application programs (which use some of those functions and&#xA;  data) to form executables.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software&#xA;  library or work which has been distributed under these terms. A&#xA;  &quot;work based on the Library&quot; means either the Library&#xA;  or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a&#xA;  work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim&#xA;  or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into&#xA;  another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without&#xA;  limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of&#xA;  the work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete&#xA;  source code means all the source code for all modules it&#xA;  contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus&#xA;  the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the&#xA;  library.&#xA;&#xA;  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are&#xA;  not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act&#xA;  of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and&#xA;  output from such a program is covered only if its contents&#xA;  constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use&#xA;  of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true&#xA;  depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses&#xA;  the Library does.&#xA;&#xA;  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the&#xA;  Library&apos;s complete source code as you receive it, in any&#xA;  medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately&#xA;  publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and&#xA;  disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer&#xA;  to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and&#xA;  distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.&#xA;&#xA;  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a&#xA;  copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in&#xA;  exchange for a fee.&#xA;&#xA;  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any&#xA;  portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and&#xA;  copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms&#xA;  of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these&#xA;  conditions:&#xA;&#xA;  a) The modified work must itself be a software library.&#xA;&#xA;  b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices&#xA;  stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.&#xA;&#xA;  c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no&#xA;  charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or&#xA;  a table of data to be supplied by an application program that&#xA;  uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the&#xA;  facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to&#xA;  ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such&#xA;  function or table, the facility still operates, and performs&#xA;  whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.&#xA;&#xA;  (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots&#xA;  has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the&#xA;  application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any&#xA;  application-supplied function or table used by this function&#xA;  must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the&#xA;  square root function must still compute square roots.)&#xA;&#xA;  These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If&#xA;  identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the&#xA;  Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and&#xA;  separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms,&#xA;  do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as&#xA;  separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as&#xA;  part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the&#xA;  distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License,&#xA;  whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire&#xA;  whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote&#xA;  it.&#xA;&#xA;  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or&#xA;  contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the&#xA;  intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of&#xA;  derivative or collective works based on the Library.&#xA;&#xA;  In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the&#xA;  Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library)&#xA;  on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring&#xA;  the other work under the scope of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General&#xA;  Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the&#xA;  Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer&#xA;  to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General&#xA;  Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a&#xA;  newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public&#xA;  License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead&#xA;  if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.&#xA;&#xA;  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for&#xA;  that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to&#xA;  all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.&#xA;&#xA;  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of&#xA;  the Library into a program that is not a library.&#xA;&#xA;  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or&#xA;  derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable&#xA;  form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you&#xA;  accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable&#xA;  source code, which must be distributed under the terms of&#xA;  Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software&#xA;  interchange.&#xA;&#xA;  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to&#xA;  copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to&#xA;  copy the source code from the same place satisfies the&#xA;  requirement to distribute the source code, even though third&#xA;  parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the&#xA;  object code.&#xA;&#xA;  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the&#xA;  Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being&#xA;  compiled or linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the&#xA;  Library&quot;. Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative&#xA;  work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of&#xA;  this License.&#xA;&#xA;  However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with&#xA;  the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the&#xA;  Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather&#xA;  than a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;. The executable is&#xA;  therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for&#xA;  distribution of such executables.&#xA;&#xA;  When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from&#xA;  a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for&#xA;  the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the&#xA;  source code is not. Whether this is true is especially&#xA;  significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if&#xA;  the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true&#xA;  is not precisely defined by law.&#xA;&#xA;  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data&#xA;  structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small&#xA;  inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of&#xA;  the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is&#xA;  legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object&#xA;  code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section&#xA;  6.)&#xA;&#xA;  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may&#xA;  distribute the object code for the work under the terms of&#xA;  Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under&#xA;  Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the&#xA;  Library itself.&#xA;&#xA;  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine&#xA;  or link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the&#xA;  Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library,&#xA;  and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided&#xA;  that the terms permit modification of the work for the&#xA;  customer&apos;s own use and reverse engineering for debugging&#xA;  such modifications.&#xA;&#xA;  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that&#xA;  the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are&#xA;  covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License.&#xA;  If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you&#xA;  must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as&#xA;  well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this&#xA;  License. Also, you must do one of these things:&#xA;&#xA;  a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding&#xA;  machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever&#xA;  changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under&#xA;  Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable&#xA;  linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable&#xA;  &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or&#xA;  source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then&#xA;  relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified&#xA;  Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the&#xA;  contents of definitions files in the Library will not&#xA;  necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the&#xA;  modified definitions.)&#xA;&#xA;  b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the&#xA;  Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a&#xA;  copy of the library already present on the user&apos;s computer&#xA;  system, rather than copying library functions into the&#xA;  executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified&#xA;  version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the&#xA;  modified version is interface-compatible with the version that&#xA;  the work was made with.&#xA;&#xA;  c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least&#xA;  three years, to give the same user the materials specified in&#xA;  Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of&#xA;  performing this distribution.&#xA;&#xA;  d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to&#xA;  copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy&#xA;  the above specified materials from the same place.&#xA;&#xA;  e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these&#xA;  materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.&#xA;&#xA;  For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses&#xA;  the Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs&#xA;  needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a&#xA;  special exception, the materials to be distributed need not&#xA;  include anything that is normally distributed (in either source&#xA;  or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and&#xA;  so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs,&#xA;  unless that component itself accompanies the executable.&#xA;&#xA;  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license&#xA;  restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally&#xA;  accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you&#xA;  cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable&#xA;  that you distribute.&#xA;&#xA;  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the&#xA;  Library side-by-side in a single library together with other&#xA;  library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute&#xA;  such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution&#xA;  of the work based on the Library and of the other library&#xA;  facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do&#xA;  these two things:&#xA;&#xA;  a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work&#xA;  based on the Library, uncombined with any other library&#xA;  facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the&#xA;  Sections above.&#xA;&#xA;  b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact&#xA;  that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining&#xA;  where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.&#xA;&#xA;  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or&#xA;  distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this&#xA;  License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link&#xA;  with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically&#xA;  terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who&#xA;  have received copies, or rights, from you under this License&#xA;  will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties&#xA;  remain in full compliance.&#xA;&#xA;  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have&#xA;  not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to&#xA;  modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These&#xA;  actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.&#xA;  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work&#xA;  based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this&#xA;  License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,&#xA;  distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.&#xA;&#xA;  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on&#xA;  the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license&#xA;  from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or&#xA;  modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You&#xA;  may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients&apos;&#xA;  exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible&#xA;  for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.&#xA;&#xA;  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of&#xA;  patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to&#xA;  patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court&#xA;  order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of&#xA;  this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this&#xA;  License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy&#xA;  simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other&#xA;  pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not&#xA;  distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license&#xA;  would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by&#xA;  all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you,&#xA;  then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License&#xA;  would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.&#xA;&#xA;  If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable&#xA;  under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is&#xA;  intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to&#xA;  apply in other circumstances.&#xA;&#xA;  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe&#xA;  any patents or other property right claims or to contest&#xA;  validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose&#xA;  of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution&#xA;  system which is implemented by public license practices. Many&#xA;  people have made generous contributions to the wide range of&#xA;  software distributed through that system in reliance on&#xA;  consistent application of that system; it is up to the&#xA;  author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute&#xA;  software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose&#xA;  that choice.&#xA;&#xA;  This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is&#xA;  believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted&#xA;  in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted&#xA;  interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library&#xA;  under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution&#xA;  limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is&#xA;  permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such&#xA;  case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in&#xA;  the body of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new&#xA;  versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.&#xA;  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present&#xA;  version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or&#xA;  concerns.&#xA;&#xA;  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the&#xA;  Library specifies a version number of this License which applies&#xA;  to it and &quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of&#xA;  following the terms and conditions either of that version or of&#xA;  any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If&#xA;  the Library does not specify a license version number, you may&#xA;  choose any version ever published by the Free Software&#xA;  Foundation.&#xA;&#xA;  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other&#xA;  free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible&#xA;  with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For&#xA;  software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation,&#xA;  write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make&#xA;  exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two&#xA;  goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our&#xA;  free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software&#xA;  generally.&#xA;&#xA;  NO WARRANTY&#xA;&#xA;  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO&#xA;  WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE&#xA;  LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT&#xA;  HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS&#xA;  IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR&#xA;  IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES&#xA;  OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE&#xA;  ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS&#xA;  WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE&#xA;  COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;&#xA;  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO&#xA;  IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY&#xA;  MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE&#xA;  LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,&#xA;  INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR&#xA;  INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS&#xA;  OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY&#xA;  YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH&#xA;  ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN&#xA;  ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;  END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;&#xA;  How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries&#xA;&#xA;  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the&#xA;  greatest possible use to the public, we recommend making it free&#xA;  software that everyone can redistribute and change. You can do&#xA;  so by permitting redistribution under these terms (or,&#xA;  alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public&#xA;  License).&#xA;&#xA;  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the&#xA;  library. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source&#xA;  file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and&#xA;  each file should have at least the &quot;copyright&quot; line&#xA;  and a pointer to where the full notice is found.&#xA;&#xA;  &lt;one line to give the library&apos;s name and a brief idea of&#xA;  what it does.&gt; Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt; &lt;name of&#xA;  author&gt;&#xA;&#xA;  This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or&#xA;  modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;  License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either&#xA;  version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later&#xA;  version.&#xA;&#xA;  This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,&#xA;  but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of&#xA;  MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU&#xA;  Lesser General Public License for more details.&#xA;&#xA;  You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;  License along with this library; if not, write to the Free&#xA;  Software Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston,&#xA;  MA 02111-1307 USA&#xA;&#xA;  Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and&#xA;  paper mail.&#xA;&#xA;  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer)&#xA;  or your school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright&#xA;  disclaimer&quot; for the library, if necessary. Here is a&#xA;  sample; alter the names:&#xA;&#xA;  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the&#xA;  library `Frob&apos; (a library for tweaking knobs) written by&#xA;  James Random Hacker.&#xA;&#xA;  &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1990 Ty Coon, President of&#xA;  Vice&#xA;&#xA;  That&apos;s all there is to it!

          GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;         Version 2.1, February 1999&#xA;&#xA; Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.&#xA;     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA&#xA; Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies&#xA; of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.&#xA;&#xA;[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts&#xA; as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence&#xA; the version number 2.1.]&#xA;&#xA;       Preamble&#xA;&#xA;  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your&#xA;freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public&#xA;Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change&#xA;free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.&#xA;&#xA;  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some&#xA;specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the&#xA;Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You&#xA;can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether&#xA;this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better&#xA;strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.&#xA;&#xA;  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,&#xA;not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that&#xA;you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge&#xA;for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get&#xA;it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of&#xA;it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do&#xA;these things.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid&#xA;distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these&#xA;rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for&#xA;you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis&#xA;or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave&#xA;you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source&#xA;code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide&#xA;complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them&#xA;with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling&#xA;it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.&#xA;&#xA;  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the&#xA;library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal&#xA;permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that&#xA;there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is&#xA;modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know&#xA;that what they have is not the original version, so that the original&#xA;author&apos;s reputation will not be affected by problems that might be&#xA;introduced by others.&#xA;&#xA;  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of&#xA;any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot&#xA;effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a&#xA;restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that&#xA;any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be&#xA;consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.&#xA;&#xA;  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the&#xA;ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser&#xA;General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and&#xA;is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use&#xA;this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those&#xA;libraries into non-free programs.&#xA;&#xA;  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using&#xA;a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a&#xA;combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary&#xA;General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the&#xA;entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General&#xA;Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with&#xA;the library.&#xA;&#xA;  We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because it&#xA;does Less to protect the user&apos;s freedom than the ordinary General&#xA;Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less&#xA;of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages&#xA;are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many&#xA;libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain&#xA;special circumstances.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to&#xA;encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes&#xA;a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be&#xA;allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free&#xA;library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this&#xA;case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free&#xA;software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free&#xA;programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of&#xA;free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in&#xA;non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU&#xA;operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating&#xA;system.&#xA;&#xA;  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the&#xA;users&apos; freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is&#xA;linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run&#xA;that program using a modified version of the Library.&#xA;&#xA;  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a&#xA;&quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;.  The&#xA;former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must&#xA;be combined with the library in order to run.&#xA;&#xA;    GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION&#xA;&#xA;  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other&#xA;program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or&#xA;other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of&#xA;this Lesser General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;).&#xA;Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data&#xA;prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs&#xA;(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work&#xA;which has been distributed under these terms.  A &quot;work based on the&#xA;Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under&#xA;copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a&#xA;portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated&#xA;straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is&#xA;included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for&#xA;making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means&#xA;all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated&#xA;interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation&#xA;and installation of the library.&#xA;&#xA;  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not&#xA;covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of&#xA;running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from&#xA;such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based&#xA;on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for&#xA;writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does&#xA;and what the program that uses the Library does.&#xA;  &#xA;  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library&apos;s&#xA;complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that&#xA;you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an&#xA;appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact&#xA;all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any&#xA;warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the&#xA;Library.&#xA;&#xA;  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,&#xA;and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a&#xA;fee.&#xA;&#xA;  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion&#xA;of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and&#xA;distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1&#xA;above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;&#xA;    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.&#xA;&#xA;    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices&#xA;    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.&#xA;&#xA;    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no&#xA;    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.&#xA;&#xA;    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a&#xA;    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses&#xA;    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility&#xA;    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,&#xA;    in the event an application does not supply such function or&#xA;    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of&#xA;    its purpose remains meaningful.&#xA;&#xA;    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has&#xA;    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the&#xA;    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any&#xA;    application-supplied function or table used by this function must&#xA;    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square&#xA;    root function must still compute square roots.)&#xA;&#xA;These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If&#xA;identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,&#xA;and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in&#xA;themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those&#xA;sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you&#xA;distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based&#xA;on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of&#xA;this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the&#xA;entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote&#xA;it.&#xA;&#xA;Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest&#xA;your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to&#xA;exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or&#xA;collective works based on the Library.&#xA;&#xA;In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library&#xA;with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of&#xA;a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under&#xA;the scope of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public&#xA;License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do&#xA;this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so&#xA;that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,&#xA;instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the&#xA;ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify&#xA;that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in&#xA;these notices.&#xA;&#xA;  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for&#xA;that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all&#xA;subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.&#xA;&#xA;  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of&#xA;the Library into a program that is not a library.&#xA;&#xA;  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or&#xA;derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form&#xA;under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany&#xA;it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which&#xA;must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a&#xA;medium customarily used for software interchange.&#xA;&#xA;  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy&#xA;from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the&#xA;source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to&#xA;distribute the source code, even though third parties are not&#xA;compelled to copy the source along with the object code.&#xA;&#xA;  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the&#xA;Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or&#xA;linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;.  Such a&#xA;work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and&#xA;therefore falls outside the scope of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library&#xA;creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it&#xA;contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses the&#xA;library&quot;.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.&#xA;Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.&#xA;&#xA;  When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header file&#xA;that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a&#xA;derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.&#xA;Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be&#xA;linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The&#xA;threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.&#xA;&#xA;  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data&#xA;structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline&#xA;functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object&#xA;file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative&#xA;work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the&#xA;Library will still fall under Section 6.)&#xA;&#xA;  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may&#xA;distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.&#xA;Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,&#xA;whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.&#xA;&#xA;  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or&#xA;link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce a&#xA;work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work&#xA;under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit&#xA;modification of the work for the customer&apos;s own use and reverse&#xA;engineering for debugging such modifications.&#xA;&#xA;  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the&#xA;Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by&#xA;this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work&#xA;during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the&#xA;copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference&#xA;directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one&#xA;of these things:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding&#xA;    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever&#xA;    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under&#xA;    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked&#xA;    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that&#xA;    uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that the&#xA;    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified&#xA;    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood&#xA;    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the&#xA;    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application&#xA;    to use the modified definitions.)&#xA;&#xA;    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the&#xA;    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a&#xA;    copy of the library already present on the user&apos;s computer system,&#xA;    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)&#xA;    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if&#xA;    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is&#xA;    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.&#xA;&#xA;    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at&#xA;    least three years, to give the same user the materials&#xA;    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more&#xA;    than the cost of performing this distribution.&#xA;&#xA;    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy&#xA;    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above&#xA;    specified materials from the same place.&#xA;&#xA;    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these&#xA;    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.&#xA;&#xA;  For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the&#xA;Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for&#xA;reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,&#xA;the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is&#xA;normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major&#xA;components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on&#xA;which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies&#xA;the executable.&#xA;&#xA;  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license&#xA;restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally&#xA;accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot&#xA;use both them and the Library together in an executable that you&#xA;distribute.&#xA;&#xA;  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the&#xA;Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library&#xA;facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined&#xA;library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on&#xA;the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise&#xA;permitted, and provided that you do these two things:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work&#xA;    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library&#xA;    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the&#xA;    Sections above.&#xA;&#xA;    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact&#xA;    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining&#xA;    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.&#xA;&#xA;  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute&#xA;the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any&#xA;attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or&#xA;distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your&#xA;rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,&#xA;or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses&#xA;terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.&#xA;&#xA;  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not&#xA;signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or&#xA;distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are&#xA;prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by&#xA;modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the&#xA;Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and&#xA;all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying&#xA;the Library or works based on it.&#xA;&#xA;  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the&#xA;Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the&#xA;original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library&#xA;subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further&#xA;restrictions on the recipients&apos; exercise of the rights granted herein.&#xA;You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with&#xA;this License.&#xA;&#xA;  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent&#xA;infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),&#xA;conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot&#xA;distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you&#xA;may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent&#xA;license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by&#xA;all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then&#xA;the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to&#xA;refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.&#xA;&#xA;If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any&#xA;particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,&#xA;and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.&#xA;&#xA;It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any&#xA;patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any&#xA;such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the&#xA;integrity of the free software distribution system which is&#xA;implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made&#xA;generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed&#xA;through that system in reliance on consistent application of that&#xA;system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing&#xA;to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot&#xA;impose that choice.&#xA;&#xA;This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to&#xA;be a consequence of the rest of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in&#xA;certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the&#xA;original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add&#xA;an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,&#xA;so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus&#xA;excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if&#xA;written in the body of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new&#xA;versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.&#xA;Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,&#xA;but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.&#xA;&#xA;Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library&#xA;specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and&#xA;&quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and&#xA;conditions either of that version or of any later version published by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a&#xA;license version number, you may choose any version ever published by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation.&#xA;&#xA;  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free&#xA;programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,&#xA;write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is&#xA;copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free&#xA;Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our&#xA;decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status&#xA;of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing&#xA;and reuse of software generally.&#xA;&#xA;       NO WARRANTY&#xA;&#xA;  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO&#xA;WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.&#xA;EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR&#xA;OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY&#xA;KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE&#xA;IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#xA;PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE&#xA;LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME&#xA;THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;&#xA;  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN&#xA;WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY&#xA;AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU&#xA;FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR&#xA;CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE&#xA;LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING&#xA;RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A&#xA;FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF&#xA;SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH&#xA;DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;       END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;&#xA;           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries&#xA;&#xA;  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest&#xA;possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that&#xA;everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting&#xA;redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the&#xA;ordinary General Public License).&#xA;&#xA;  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is&#xA;safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively&#xA;convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the&#xA;&quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.&#xA;&#xA;    &lt;one line to give the library&apos;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;&#xA;    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;&#xA;&#xA;    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or&#xA;    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either&#xA;    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.&#xA;&#xA;    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,&#xA;    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of&#xA;    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU&#xA;    Lesser General Public License for more details.&#xA;&#xA;    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software&#xA;    Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA&#xA;&#xA;Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.&#xA;&#xA;You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your&#xA;school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the library, if&#xA;necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:&#xA;&#xA;  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the&#xA;  library `Frob&apos; (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.&#xA;&#xA;  &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1990&#xA;  Ty Coon, President of Vice&#xA;&#xA;That&apos;s all there is to it!

          GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 2.1, February 1999&#xA;&#xA;  Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 59&#xA;  Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA Everyone is&#xA;  permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license&#xA;  document, but changing it is not allowed.&#xA;&#xA;  [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also&#xA;  counts as the successor of the GNU Library Public License,&#xA;  version 2, hence the version number 2.1.]&#xA;&#xA;  Preamble&#xA;&#xA;  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your&#xA;  freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General&#xA;  Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share&#xA;  and change free software--to make sure the software is free for&#xA;  all its users.&#xA;&#xA;  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some&#xA;  specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of&#xA;  the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use&#xA;  it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully&#xA;  about whether this license or the ordinary General Public&#xA;  License is the better strategy to use in any particular case,&#xA;  based on the explanations below.&#xA;&#xA;  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of&#xA;  use, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make&#xA;  sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free&#xA;  software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you&#xA;  receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can&#xA;  change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs;&#xA;  and that you are informed that you can do these things.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid&#xA;  distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender&#xA;  these rights. These restrictions translate to certain&#xA;  responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library&#xA;  or if you modify it.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether&#xA;  gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights&#xA;  that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or&#xA;  can get the source code. If you link other code with the&#xA;  library, you must provide complete object files to the&#xA;  recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after&#xA;  making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must&#xA;  show them these terms so they know their rights.&#xA;&#xA;  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright&#xA;  the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you&#xA;  legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that&#xA;  there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library&#xA;  is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should&#xA;  know that what they have is not the original version, so that&#xA;  the original author&apos;s reputation will not be affected by&#xA;  problems that might be introduced by others.&#xA;&#xA;  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the&#xA;  existence of any free program. We wish to make sure that a&#xA;  company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program&#xA;  by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder.&#xA;  Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a&#xA;  version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom&#xA;  of use specified in this license.&#xA;&#xA;  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the&#xA;  ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU&#xA;  Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated&#xA;  libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General&#xA;  Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in&#xA;  order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.&#xA;&#xA;  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or&#xA;  using a shared library, the combination of the two is legally&#xA;  speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library.&#xA;  The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such&#xA;  linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of&#xA;  freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax&#xA;  criteria for linking other code with the library.&#xA;&#xA;  We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public&#xA;  License because it does Less to protect the user&apos;s freedom&#xA;  than the ordinary General Public License. It also provides other&#xA;  free software developers Less of an advantage over competing&#xA;  non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the&#xA;  ordinary General Public License for many libraries. However, the&#xA;  Lesser license provides advantages in certain special&#xA;  circumstances.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to&#xA;  encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that&#xA;  it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free&#xA;  programs must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent&#xA;  case is that a free library does the same job as widely used&#xA;  non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by&#xA;  limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the&#xA;  Lesser General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in&#xA;  non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a&#xA;  large body of free software. For example, permission to use the&#xA;  GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to&#xA;  use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the&#xA;  GNU/Linux operating system.&#xA;&#xA;  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of&#xA;  the users&apos; freedom, it does ensure that the user of a&#xA;  program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the&#xA;  wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the&#xA;  Library.&#xA;&#xA;  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;  modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference&#xA;  between a &quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work&#xA;  that uses the library&quot;. The former contains code derived&#xA;  from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the&#xA;  library in order to run.&#xA;&#xA;  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR&#xA;  COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION&#xA;&#xA;  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or&#xA;  other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright&#xA;  holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed&#xA;  under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also&#xA;  called &quot;this License&quot;). Each licensee is addressed as&#xA;  &quot;you&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions&#xA;  and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with&#xA;  application programs (which use some of those functions and&#xA;  data) to form executables.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software&#xA;  library or work which has been distributed under these terms. A&#xA;  &quot;work based on the Library&quot; means either the Library&#xA;  or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a&#xA;  work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim&#xA;  or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into&#xA;  another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without&#xA;  limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of&#xA;  the work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete&#xA;  source code means all the source code for all modules it&#xA;  contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus&#xA;  the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the&#xA;  library.&#xA;&#xA;  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are&#xA;  not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act&#xA;  of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and&#xA;  output from such a program is covered only if its contents&#xA;  constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use&#xA;  of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true&#xA;  depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses&#xA;  the Library does.&#xA;&#xA;  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the&#xA;  Library&apos;s complete source code as you receive it, in any&#xA;  medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately&#xA;  publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and&#xA;  disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer&#xA;  to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and&#xA;  distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.&#xA;&#xA;  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a&#xA;  copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in&#xA;  exchange for a fee.&#xA;&#xA;  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any&#xA;  portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and&#xA;  copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms&#xA;  of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these&#xA;  conditions:&#xA;&#xA;  a) The modified work must itself be a software library.&#xA;&#xA;  b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices&#xA;  stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.&#xA;&#xA;  c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no&#xA;  charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or&#xA;  a table of data to be supplied by an application program that&#xA;  uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the&#xA;  facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to&#xA;  ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such&#xA;  function or table, the facility still operates, and performs&#xA;  whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.&#xA;&#xA;  (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots&#xA;  has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the&#xA;  application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any&#xA;  application-supplied function or table used by this function&#xA;  must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the&#xA;  square root function must still compute square roots.)&#xA;&#xA;  These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If&#xA;  identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the&#xA;  Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and&#xA;  separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms,&#xA;  do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as&#xA;  separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as&#xA;  part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the&#xA;  distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License,&#xA;  whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire&#xA;  whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote&#xA;  it.&#xA;&#xA;  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or&#xA;  contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the&#xA;  intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of&#xA;  derivative or collective works based on the Library.&#xA;&#xA;  In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the&#xA;  Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library)&#xA;  on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring&#xA;  the other work under the scope of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General&#xA;  Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the&#xA;  Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer&#xA;  to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General&#xA;  Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a&#xA;  newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public&#xA;  License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead&#xA;  if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.&#xA;&#xA;  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for&#xA;  that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to&#xA;  all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.&#xA;&#xA;  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of&#xA;  the Library into a program that is not a library.&#xA;&#xA;  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or&#xA;  derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable&#xA;  form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you&#xA;  accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable&#xA;  source code, which must be distributed under the terms of&#xA;  Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software&#xA;  interchange.&#xA;&#xA;  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to&#xA;  copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to&#xA;  copy the source code from the same place satisfies the&#xA;  requirement to distribute the source code, even though third&#xA;  parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the&#xA;  object code.&#xA;&#xA;  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the&#xA;  Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being&#xA;  compiled or linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the&#xA;  Library&quot;. Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative&#xA;  work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of&#xA;  this License.&#xA;&#xA;  However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with&#xA;  the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the&#xA;  Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather&#xA;  than a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;. The executable is&#xA;  therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for&#xA;  distribution of such executables.&#xA;&#xA;  When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from&#xA;  a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for&#xA;  the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the&#xA;  source code is not. Whether this is true is especially&#xA;  significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if&#xA;  the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true&#xA;  is not precisely defined by law.&#xA;&#xA;  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data&#xA;  structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small&#xA;  inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of&#xA;  the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is&#xA;  legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object&#xA;  code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section&#xA;  6.)&#xA;&#xA;  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may&#xA;  distribute the object code for the work under the terms of&#xA;  Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under&#xA;  Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the&#xA;  Library itself.&#xA;&#xA;  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine&#xA;  or link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the&#xA;  Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library,&#xA;  and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided&#xA;  that the terms permit modification of the work for the&#xA;  customer&apos;s own use and reverse engineering for debugging&#xA;  such modifications.&#xA;&#xA;  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that&#xA;  the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are&#xA;  covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License.&#xA;  If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you&#xA;  must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as&#xA;  well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this&#xA;  License. Also, you must do one of these things:&#xA;&#xA;  a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding&#xA;  machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever&#xA;  changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under&#xA;  Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable&#xA;  linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable&#xA;  &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or&#xA;  source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then&#xA;  relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified&#xA;  Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the&#xA;  contents of definitions files in the Library will not&#xA;  necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the&#xA;  modified definitions.)&#xA;&#xA;  b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the&#xA;  Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a&#xA;  copy of the library already present on the user&apos;s computer&#xA;  system, rather than copying library functions into the&#xA;  executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified&#xA;  version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the&#xA;  modified version is interface-compatible with the version that&#xA;  the work was made with.&#xA;&#xA;  c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least&#xA;  three years, to give the same user the materials specified in&#xA;  Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of&#xA;  performing this distribution.&#xA;&#xA;  d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to&#xA;  copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy&#xA;  the above specified materials from the same place.&#xA;&#xA;  e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these&#xA;  materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.&#xA;&#xA;  For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses&#xA;  the Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs&#xA;  needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a&#xA;  special exception, the materials to be distributed need not&#xA;  include anything that is normally distributed (in either source&#xA;  or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and&#xA;  so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs,&#xA;  unless that component itself accompanies the executable.&#xA;&#xA;  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license&#xA;  restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally&#xA;  accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you&#xA;  cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable&#xA;  that you distribute.&#xA;&#xA;  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the&#xA;  Library side-by-side in a single library together with other&#xA;  library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute&#xA;  such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution&#xA;  of the work based on the Library and of the other library&#xA;  facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do&#xA;  these two things:&#xA;&#xA;  a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work&#xA;  based on the Library, uncombined with any other library&#xA;  facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the&#xA;  Sections above.&#xA;&#xA;  b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact&#xA;  that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining&#xA;  where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.&#xA;&#xA;  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or&#xA;  distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this&#xA;  License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link&#xA;  with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically&#xA;  terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who&#xA;  have received copies, or rights, from you under this License&#xA;  will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties&#xA;  remain in full compliance.&#xA;&#xA;  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have&#xA;  not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to&#xA;  modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These&#xA;  actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.&#xA;  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work&#xA;  based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this&#xA;  License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,&#xA;  distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.&#xA;&#xA;  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on&#xA;  the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license&#xA;  from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or&#xA;  modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You&#xA;  may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients&apos;&#xA;  exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible&#xA;  for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.&#xA;&#xA;  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of&#xA;  patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to&#xA;  patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court&#xA;  order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of&#xA;  this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this&#xA;  License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy&#xA;  simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other&#xA;  pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not&#xA;  distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license&#xA;  would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by&#xA;  all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you,&#xA;  then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License&#xA;  would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.&#xA;&#xA;  If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable&#xA;  under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is&#xA;  intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to&#xA;  apply in other circumstances.&#xA;&#xA;  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe&#xA;  any patents or other property right claims or to contest&#xA;  validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose&#xA;  of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution&#xA;  system which is implemented by public license practices. Many&#xA;  people have made generous contributions to the wide range of&#xA;  software distributed through that system in reliance on&#xA;  consistent application of that system; it is up to the&#xA;  author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute&#xA;  software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose&#xA;  that choice.&#xA;&#xA;  This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is&#xA;  believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted&#xA;  in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted&#xA;  interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library&#xA;  under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution&#xA;  limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is&#xA;  permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such&#xA;  case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in&#xA;  the body of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new&#xA;  versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.&#xA;  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present&#xA;  version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or&#xA;  concerns.&#xA;&#xA;  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the&#xA;  Library specifies a version number of this License which applies&#xA;  to it and &quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of&#xA;  following the terms and conditions either of that version or of&#xA;  any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If&#xA;  the Library does not specify a license version number, you may&#xA;  choose any version ever published by the Free Software&#xA;  Foundation.&#xA;&#xA;  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other&#xA;  free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible&#xA;  with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For&#xA;  software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation,&#xA;  write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make&#xA;  exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two&#xA;  goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our&#xA;  free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software&#xA;  generally.&#xA;&#xA;  NO WARRANTY&#xA;&#xA;  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO&#xA;  WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE&#xA;  LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT&#xA;  HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS&#xA;  IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR&#xA;  IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES&#xA;  OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE&#xA;  ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS&#xA;  WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE&#xA;  COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;&#xA;  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO&#xA;  IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY&#xA;  MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE&#xA;  LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,&#xA;  INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR&#xA;  INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS&#xA;  OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY&#xA;  YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH&#xA;  ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN&#xA;  ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;  END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;&#xA;  How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries&#xA;&#xA;  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the&#xA;  greatest possible use to the public, we recommend making it free&#xA;  software that everyone can redistribute and change. You can do&#xA;  so by permitting redistribution under these terms (or,&#xA;  alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public&#xA;  License).&#xA;&#xA;  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the&#xA;  library. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source&#xA;  file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and&#xA;  each file should have at least the &quot;copyright&quot; line&#xA;  and a pointer to where the full notice is found.&#xA;&#xA;  &lt;one line to give the library&apos;s name and a brief idea of&#xA;  what it does.&gt; Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt; &lt;name of&#xA;  author&gt;&#xA;&#xA;  This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or&#xA;  modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;  License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either&#xA;  version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later&#xA;  version.&#xA;&#xA;  This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,&#xA;  but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of&#xA;  MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU&#xA;  Lesser General Public License for more details.&#xA;&#xA;  You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;  License along with this library; if not, write to the Free&#xA;  Software Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston,&#xA;  MA 02111-1307 USA&#xA;&#xA;  Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and&#xA;  paper mail.&#xA;&#xA;  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer)&#xA;  or your school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright&#xA;  disclaimer&quot; for the library, if necessary. Here is a&#xA;  sample; alter the names:&#xA;&#xA;  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the&#xA;  library `Frob&apos; (a library for tweaking knobs) written by&#xA;  James Random Hacker.&#xA;&#xA;  &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1990 Ty Coon, President of&#xA;  Vice&#xA;&#xA;  That&apos;s all there is to it!

          GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;         Version 2.1, February 1999&#xA;&#xA; Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.&#xA;     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA&#xA; Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies&#xA; of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.&#xA;&#xA;[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts&#xA; as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence&#xA; the version number 2.1.]&#xA;&#xA;       Preamble&#xA;&#xA;  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your&#xA;freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public&#xA;Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change&#xA;free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.&#xA;&#xA;  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some&#xA;specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the&#xA;Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You&#xA;can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether&#xA;this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better&#xA;strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.&#xA;&#xA;  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,&#xA;not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that&#xA;you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge&#xA;for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get&#xA;it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of&#xA;it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do&#xA;these things.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid&#xA;distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these&#xA;rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for&#xA;you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis&#xA;or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave&#xA;you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source&#xA;code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide&#xA;complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them&#xA;with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling&#xA;it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.&#xA;&#xA;  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the&#xA;library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal&#xA;permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that&#xA;there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is&#xA;modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know&#xA;that what they have is not the original version, so that the original&#xA;author&apos;s reputation will not be affected by problems that might be&#xA;introduced by others.&#xA;&#xA;  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of&#xA;any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot&#xA;effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a&#xA;restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that&#xA;any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be&#xA;consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.&#xA;&#xA;  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the&#xA;ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser&#xA;General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and&#xA;is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use&#xA;this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those&#xA;libraries into non-free programs.&#xA;&#xA;  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using&#xA;a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a&#xA;combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary&#xA;General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the&#xA;entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General&#xA;Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with&#xA;the library.&#xA;&#xA;  We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because it&#xA;does Less to protect the user&apos;s freedom than the ordinary General&#xA;Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less&#xA;of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages&#xA;are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many&#xA;libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain&#xA;special circumstances.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to&#xA;encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes&#xA;a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be&#xA;allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free&#xA;library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this&#xA;case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free&#xA;software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free&#xA;programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of&#xA;free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in&#xA;non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU&#xA;operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating&#xA;system.&#xA;&#xA;  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the&#xA;users&apos; freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is&#xA;linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run&#xA;that program using a modified version of the Library.&#xA;&#xA;  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a&#xA;&quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;.  The&#xA;former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must&#xA;be combined with the library in order to run.&#xA;&#xA;    GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION&#xA;&#xA;  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other&#xA;program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or&#xA;other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of&#xA;this Lesser General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;).&#xA;Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data&#xA;prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs&#xA;(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work&#xA;which has been distributed under these terms.  A &quot;work based on the&#xA;Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under&#xA;copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a&#xA;portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated&#xA;straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is&#xA;included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for&#xA;making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means&#xA;all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated&#xA;interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation&#xA;and installation of the library.&#xA;&#xA;  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not&#xA;covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of&#xA;running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from&#xA;such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based&#xA;on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for&#xA;writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does&#xA;and what the program that uses the Library does.&#xA;  &#xA;  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library&apos;s&#xA;complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that&#xA;you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an&#xA;appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact&#xA;all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any&#xA;warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the&#xA;Library.&#xA;&#xA;  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,&#xA;and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a&#xA;fee.&#xA;&#xA;  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion&#xA;of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and&#xA;distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1&#xA;above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;&#xA;    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.&#xA;&#xA;    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices&#xA;    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.&#xA;&#xA;    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no&#xA;    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.&#xA;&#xA;    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a&#xA;    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses&#xA;    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility&#xA;    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,&#xA;    in the event an application does not supply such function or&#xA;    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of&#xA;    its purpose remains meaningful.&#xA;&#xA;    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has&#xA;    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the&#xA;    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any&#xA;    application-supplied function or table used by this function must&#xA;    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square&#xA;    root function must still compute square roots.)&#xA;&#xA;These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If&#xA;identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,&#xA;and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in&#xA;themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those&#xA;sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you&#xA;distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based&#xA;on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of&#xA;this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the&#xA;entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote&#xA;it.&#xA;&#xA;Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest&#xA;your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to&#xA;exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or&#xA;collective works based on the Library.&#xA;&#xA;In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library&#xA;with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of&#xA;a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under&#xA;the scope of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public&#xA;License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do&#xA;this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so&#xA;that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,&#xA;instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the&#xA;ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify&#xA;that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in&#xA;these notices.&#xA;&#xA;  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for&#xA;that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all&#xA;subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.&#xA;&#xA;  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of&#xA;the Library into a program that is not a library.&#xA;&#xA;  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or&#xA;derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form&#xA;under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany&#xA;it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which&#xA;must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a&#xA;medium customarily used for software interchange.&#xA;&#xA;  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy&#xA;from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the&#xA;source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to&#xA;distribute the source code, even though third parties are not&#xA;compelled to copy the source along with the object code.&#xA;&#xA;  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the&#xA;Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or&#xA;linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;.  Such a&#xA;work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and&#xA;therefore falls outside the scope of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library&#xA;creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it&#xA;contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses the&#xA;library&quot;.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.&#xA;Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.&#xA;&#xA;  When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header file&#xA;that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a&#xA;derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.&#xA;Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be&#xA;linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The&#xA;threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.&#xA;&#xA;  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data&#xA;structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline&#xA;functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object&#xA;file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative&#xA;work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the&#xA;Library will still fall under Section 6.)&#xA;&#xA;  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may&#xA;distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.&#xA;Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,&#xA;whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.&#xA;&#xA;  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or&#xA;link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce a&#xA;work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work&#xA;under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit&#xA;modification of the work for the customer&apos;s own use and reverse&#xA;engineering for debugging such modifications.&#xA;&#xA;  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the&#xA;Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by&#xA;this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work&#xA;during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the&#xA;copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference&#xA;directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one&#xA;of these things:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding&#xA;    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever&#xA;    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under&#xA;    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked&#xA;    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that&#xA;    uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that the&#xA;    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified&#xA;    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood&#xA;    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the&#xA;    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application&#xA;    to use the modified definitions.)&#xA;&#xA;    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the&#xA;    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a&#xA;    copy of the library already present on the user&apos;s computer system,&#xA;    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)&#xA;    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if&#xA;    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is&#xA;    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.&#xA;&#xA;    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at&#xA;    least three years, to give the same user the materials&#xA;    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more&#xA;    than the cost of performing this distribution.&#xA;&#xA;    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy&#xA;    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above&#xA;    specified materials from the same place.&#xA;&#xA;    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these&#xA;    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.&#xA;&#xA;  For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the&#xA;Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for&#xA;reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,&#xA;the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is&#xA;normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major&#xA;components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on&#xA;which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies&#xA;the executable.&#xA;&#xA;  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license&#xA;restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally&#xA;accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot&#xA;use both them and the Library together in an executable that you&#xA;distribute.&#xA;&#xA;  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the&#xA;Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library&#xA;facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined&#xA;library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on&#xA;the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise&#xA;permitted, and provided that you do these two things:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work&#xA;    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library&#xA;    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the&#xA;    Sections above.&#xA;&#xA;    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact&#xA;    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining&#xA;    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.&#xA;&#xA;  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute&#xA;the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any&#xA;attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or&#xA;distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your&#xA;rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,&#xA;or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses&#xA;terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.&#xA;&#xA;  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not&#xA;signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or&#xA;distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are&#xA;prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by&#xA;modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the&#xA;Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and&#xA;all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying&#xA;the Library or works based on it.&#xA;&#xA;  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the&#xA;Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the&#xA;original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library&#xA;subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further&#xA;restrictions on the recipients&apos; exercise of the rights granted herein.&#xA;You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with&#xA;this License.&#xA;&#xA;  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent&#xA;infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),&#xA;conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot&#xA;distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you&#xA;may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent&#xA;license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by&#xA;all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then&#xA;the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to&#xA;refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.&#xA;&#xA;If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any&#xA;particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,&#xA;and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.&#xA;&#xA;It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any&#xA;patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any&#xA;such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the&#xA;integrity of the free software distribution system which is&#xA;implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made&#xA;generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed&#xA;through that system in reliance on consistent application of that&#xA;system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing&#xA;to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot&#xA;impose that choice.&#xA;&#xA;This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to&#xA;be a consequence of the rest of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in&#xA;certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the&#xA;original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add&#xA;an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,&#xA;so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus&#xA;excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if&#xA;written in the body of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new&#xA;versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.&#xA;Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,&#xA;but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.&#xA;&#xA;Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library&#xA;specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and&#xA;&quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and&#xA;conditions either of that version or of any later version published by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a&#xA;license version number, you may choose any version ever published by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation.&#xA;&#xA;  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free&#xA;programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,&#xA;write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is&#xA;copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free&#xA;Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our&#xA;decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status&#xA;of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing&#xA;and reuse of software generally.&#xA;&#xA;       NO WARRANTY&#xA;&#xA;  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO&#xA;WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.&#xA;EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR&#xA;OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY&#xA;KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE&#xA;IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#xA;PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE&#xA;LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME&#xA;THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;&#xA;  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN&#xA;WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY&#xA;AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU&#xA;FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR&#xA;CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE&#xA;LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING&#xA;RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A&#xA;FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF&#xA;SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH&#xA;DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;       END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;&#xA;           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries&#xA;&#xA;  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest&#xA;possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that&#xA;everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting&#xA;redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the&#xA;ordinary General Public License).&#xA;&#xA;  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is&#xA;safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively&#xA;convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the&#xA;&quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.&#xA;&#xA;    &lt;one line to give the library&apos;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;&#xA;    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;&#xA;&#xA;    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or&#xA;    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either&#xA;    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.&#xA;&#xA;    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,&#xA;    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of&#xA;    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU&#xA;    Lesser General Public License for more details.&#xA;&#xA;    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software&#xA;    Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA&#xA;&#xA;Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.&#xA;&#xA;You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your&#xA;school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the library, if&#xA;necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:&#xA;&#xA;  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the&#xA;  library `Frob&apos; (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.&#xA;&#xA;  &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1990&#xA;  Ty Coon, President of Vice&#xA;&#xA;That&apos;s all there is to it!

          GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;         Version 2.1, February 1999&#xA;&#xA; Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.&#xA;     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA&#xA; Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies&#xA; of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.&#xA;&#xA;[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts&#xA; as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence&#xA; the version number 2.1.]&#xA;&#xA;       Preamble&#xA;&#xA;  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your&#xA;freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public&#xA;Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change&#xA;free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.&#xA;&#xA;  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some&#xA;specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the&#xA;Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You&#xA;can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether&#xA;this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better&#xA;strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.&#xA;&#xA;  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,&#xA;not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that&#xA;you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge&#xA;for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get&#xA;it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of&#xA;it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do&#xA;these things.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid&#xA;distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these&#xA;rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for&#xA;you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis&#xA;or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave&#xA;you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source&#xA;code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide&#xA;complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them&#xA;with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling&#xA;it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.&#xA;&#xA;  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the&#xA;library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal&#xA;permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that&#xA;there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is&#xA;modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know&#xA;that what they have is not the original version, so that the original&#xA;author&apos;s reputation will not be affected by problems that might be&#xA;introduced by others.&#xA;&#xA;  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of&#xA;any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot&#xA;effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a&#xA;restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that&#xA;any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be&#xA;consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.&#xA;&#xA;  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the&#xA;ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser&#xA;General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and&#xA;is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use&#xA;this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those&#xA;libraries into non-free programs.&#xA;&#xA;  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using&#xA;a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a&#xA;combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary&#xA;General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the&#xA;entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General&#xA;Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with&#xA;the library.&#xA;&#xA;  We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because it&#xA;does Less to protect the user&apos;s freedom than the ordinary General&#xA;Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less&#xA;of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages&#xA;are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many&#xA;libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain&#xA;special circumstances.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to&#xA;encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes&#xA;a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be&#xA;allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free&#xA;library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this&#xA;case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free&#xA;software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free&#xA;programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of&#xA;free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in&#xA;non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU&#xA;operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating&#xA;system.&#xA;&#xA;  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the&#xA;users&apos; freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is&#xA;linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run&#xA;that program using a modified version of the Library.&#xA;&#xA;  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a&#xA;&quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;.  The&#xA;former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must&#xA;be combined with the library in order to run.&#xA;&#xA;    GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION&#xA;&#xA;  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other&#xA;program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or&#xA;other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of&#xA;this Lesser General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;).&#xA;Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data&#xA;prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs&#xA;(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work&#xA;which has been distributed under these terms.  A &quot;work based on the&#xA;Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under&#xA;copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a&#xA;portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated&#xA;straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is&#xA;included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for&#xA;making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means&#xA;all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated&#xA;interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation&#xA;and installation of the library.&#xA;&#xA;  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not&#xA;covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of&#xA;running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from&#xA;such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based&#xA;on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for&#xA;writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does&#xA;and what the program that uses the Library does.&#xA;  &#xA;  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library&apos;s&#xA;complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that&#xA;you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an&#xA;appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact&#xA;all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any&#xA;warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the&#xA;Library.&#xA;&#xA;  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,&#xA;and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a&#xA;fee.&#xA;&#xA;  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion&#xA;of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and&#xA;distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1&#xA;above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;&#xA;    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.&#xA;&#xA;    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices&#xA;    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.&#xA;&#xA;    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no&#xA;    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.&#xA;&#xA;    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a&#xA;    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses&#xA;    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility&#xA;    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,&#xA;    in the event an application does not supply such function or&#xA;    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of&#xA;    its purpose remains meaningful.&#xA;&#xA;    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has&#xA;    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the&#xA;    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any&#xA;    application-supplied function or table used by this function must&#xA;    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square&#xA;    root function must still compute square roots.)&#xA;&#xA;These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If&#xA;identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,&#xA;and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in&#xA;themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those&#xA;sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you&#xA;distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based&#xA;on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of&#xA;this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the&#xA;entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote&#xA;it.&#xA;&#xA;Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest&#xA;your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to&#xA;exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or&#xA;collective works based on the Library.&#xA;&#xA;In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library&#xA;with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of&#xA;a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under&#xA;the scope of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public&#xA;License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do&#xA;this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so&#xA;that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,&#xA;instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the&#xA;ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify&#xA;that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in&#xA;these notices.&#xA;&#xA;  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for&#xA;that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all&#xA;subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.&#xA;&#xA;  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of&#xA;the Library into a program that is not a library.&#xA;&#xA;  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or&#xA;derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form&#xA;under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany&#xA;it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which&#xA;must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a&#xA;medium customarily used for software interchange.&#xA;&#xA;  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy&#xA;from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the&#xA;source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to&#xA;distribute the source code, even though third parties are not&#xA;compelled to copy the source along with the object code.&#xA;&#xA;  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the&#xA;Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or&#xA;linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;.  Such a&#xA;work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and&#xA;therefore falls outside the scope of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library&#xA;creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it&#xA;contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses the&#xA;library&quot;.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.&#xA;Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.&#xA;&#xA;  When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header file&#xA;that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a&#xA;derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.&#xA;Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be&#xA;linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The&#xA;threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.&#xA;&#xA;  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data&#xA;structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline&#xA;functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object&#xA;file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative&#xA;work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the&#xA;Library will still fall under Section 6.)&#xA;&#xA;  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may&#xA;distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.&#xA;Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,&#xA;whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.&#xA;&#xA;  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or&#xA;link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce a&#xA;work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work&#xA;under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit&#xA;modification of the work for the customer&apos;s own use and reverse&#xA;engineering for debugging such modifications.&#xA;&#xA;  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the&#xA;Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by&#xA;this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work&#xA;during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the&#xA;copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference&#xA;directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one&#xA;of these things:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding&#xA;    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever&#xA;    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under&#xA;    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked&#xA;    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that&#xA;    uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that the&#xA;    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified&#xA;    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood&#xA;    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the&#xA;    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application&#xA;    to use the modified definitions.)&#xA;&#xA;    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the&#xA;    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a&#xA;    copy of the library already present on the user&apos;s computer system,&#xA;    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)&#xA;    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if&#xA;    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is&#xA;    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.&#xA;&#xA;    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at&#xA;    least three years, to give the same user the materials&#xA;    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more&#xA;    than the cost of performing this distribution.&#xA;&#xA;    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy&#xA;    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above&#xA;    specified materials from the same place.&#xA;&#xA;    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these&#xA;    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.&#xA;&#xA;  For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the&#xA;Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for&#xA;reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,&#xA;the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is&#xA;normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major&#xA;components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on&#xA;which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies&#xA;the executable.&#xA;&#xA;  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license&#xA;restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally&#xA;accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot&#xA;use both them and the Library together in an executable that you&#xA;distribute.&#xA;&#xA;  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the&#xA;Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library&#xA;facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined&#xA;library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on&#xA;the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise&#xA;permitted, and provided that you do these two things:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work&#xA;    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library&#xA;    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the&#xA;    Sections above.&#xA;&#xA;    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact&#xA;    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining&#xA;    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.&#xA;&#xA;  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute&#xA;the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any&#xA;attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or&#xA;distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your&#xA;rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,&#xA;or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses&#xA;terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.&#xA;&#xA;  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not&#xA;signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or&#xA;distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are&#xA;prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by&#xA;modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the&#xA;Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and&#xA;all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying&#xA;the Library or works based on it.&#xA;&#xA;  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the&#xA;Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the&#xA;original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library&#xA;subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further&#xA;restrictions on the recipients&apos; exercise of the rights granted herein.&#xA;You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with&#xA;this License.&#xA;&#xA;  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent&#xA;infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),&#xA;conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot&#xA;distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you&#xA;may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent&#xA;license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by&#xA;all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then&#xA;the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to&#xA;refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.&#xA;&#xA;If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any&#xA;particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,&#xA;and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.&#xA;&#xA;It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any&#xA;patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any&#xA;such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the&#xA;integrity of the free software distribution system which is&#xA;implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made&#xA;generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed&#xA;through that system in reliance on consistent application of that&#xA;system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing&#xA;to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot&#xA;impose that choice.&#xA;&#xA;This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to&#xA;be a consequence of the rest of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in&#xA;certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the&#xA;original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add&#xA;an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,&#xA;so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus&#xA;excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if&#xA;written in the body of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new&#xA;versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.&#xA;Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,&#xA;but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.&#xA;&#xA;Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library&#xA;specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and&#xA;&quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and&#xA;conditions either of that version or of any later version published by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a&#xA;license version number, you may choose any version ever published by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation.&#xA;&#xA;  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free&#xA;programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,&#xA;write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is&#xA;copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free&#xA;Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our&#xA;decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status&#xA;of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing&#xA;and reuse of software generally.&#xA;&#xA;       NO WARRANTY&#xA;&#xA;  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO&#xA;WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.&#xA;EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR&#xA;OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY&#xA;KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE&#xA;IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#xA;PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE&#xA;LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME&#xA;THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;&#xA;  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN&#xA;WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY&#xA;AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU&#xA;FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR&#xA;CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE&#xA;LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING&#xA;RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A&#xA;FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF&#xA;SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH&#xA;DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;       END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;&#xA;           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries&#xA;&#xA;  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest&#xA;possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that&#xA;everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting&#xA;redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the&#xA;ordinary General Public License).&#xA;&#xA;  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is&#xA;safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively&#xA;convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the&#xA;&quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.&#xA;&#xA;    &lt;one line to give the library&apos;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;&#xA;    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;&#xA;&#xA;    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or&#xA;    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either&#xA;    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.&#xA;&#xA;    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,&#xA;    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of&#xA;    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU&#xA;    Lesser General Public License for more details.&#xA;&#xA;    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software&#xA;    Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA&#xA;&#xA;Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.&#xA;&#xA;You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your&#xA;school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the library, if&#xA;necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:&#xA;&#xA;  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the&#xA;  library `Frob&apos; (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.&#xA;&#xA;  &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1990&#xA;  Ty Coon, President of Vice&#xA;&#xA;That&apos;s all there is to it!

          GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 2.1, February 1999&#xA;&#xA;  Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 59&#xA;  Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA Everyone is&#xA;  permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license&#xA;  document, but changing it is not allowed.&#xA;&#xA;  [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also&#xA;  counts as the successor of the GNU Library Public License,&#xA;  version 2, hence the version number 2.1.]&#xA;&#xA;  Preamble&#xA;&#xA;  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your&#xA;  freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General&#xA;  Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share&#xA;  and change free software--to make sure the software is free for&#xA;  all its users.&#xA;&#xA;  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some&#xA;  specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of&#xA;  the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use&#xA;  it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully&#xA;  about whether this license or the ordinary General Public&#xA;  License is the better strategy to use in any particular case,&#xA;  based on the explanations below.&#xA;&#xA;  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of&#xA;  use, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make&#xA;  sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free&#xA;  software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you&#xA;  receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can&#xA;  change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs;&#xA;  and that you are informed that you can do these things.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid&#xA;  distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender&#xA;  these rights. These restrictions translate to certain&#xA;  responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library&#xA;  or if you modify it.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether&#xA;  gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights&#xA;  that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or&#xA;  can get the source code. If you link other code with the&#xA;  library, you must provide complete object files to the&#xA;  recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after&#xA;  making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must&#xA;  show them these terms so they know their rights.&#xA;&#xA;  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright&#xA;  the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you&#xA;  legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that&#xA;  there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library&#xA;  is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should&#xA;  know that what they have is not the original version, so that&#xA;  the original author&apos;s reputation will not be affected by&#xA;  problems that might be introduced by others.&#xA;&#xA;  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the&#xA;  existence of any free program. We wish to make sure that a&#xA;  company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program&#xA;  by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder.&#xA;  Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a&#xA;  version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom&#xA;  of use specified in this license.&#xA;&#xA;  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the&#xA;  ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU&#xA;  Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated&#xA;  libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General&#xA;  Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in&#xA;  order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.&#xA;&#xA;  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or&#xA;  using a shared library, the combination of the two is legally&#xA;  speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library.&#xA;  The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such&#xA;  linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of&#xA;  freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax&#xA;  criteria for linking other code with the library.&#xA;&#xA;  We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public&#xA;  License because it does Less to protect the user&apos;s freedom&#xA;  than the ordinary General Public License. It also provides other&#xA;  free software developers Less of an advantage over competing&#xA;  non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the&#xA;  ordinary General Public License for many libraries. However, the&#xA;  Lesser license provides advantages in certain special&#xA;  circumstances.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to&#xA;  encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that&#xA;  it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free&#xA;  programs must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent&#xA;  case is that a free library does the same job as widely used&#xA;  non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by&#xA;  limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the&#xA;  Lesser General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in&#xA;  non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a&#xA;  large body of free software. For example, permission to use the&#xA;  GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to&#xA;  use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the&#xA;  GNU/Linux operating system.&#xA;&#xA;  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of&#xA;  the users&apos; freedom, it does ensure that the user of a&#xA;  program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the&#xA;  wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the&#xA;  Library.&#xA;&#xA;  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;  modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference&#xA;  between a &quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work&#xA;  that uses the library&quot;. The former contains code derived&#xA;  from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the&#xA;  library in order to run.&#xA;&#xA;  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR&#xA;  COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION&#xA;&#xA;  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or&#xA;  other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright&#xA;  holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed&#xA;  under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also&#xA;  called &quot;this License&quot;). Each licensee is addressed as&#xA;  &quot;you&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions&#xA;  and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with&#xA;  application programs (which use some of those functions and&#xA;  data) to form executables.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software&#xA;  library or work which has been distributed under these terms. A&#xA;  &quot;work based on the Library&quot; means either the Library&#xA;  or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a&#xA;  work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim&#xA;  or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into&#xA;  another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without&#xA;  limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of&#xA;  the work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete&#xA;  source code means all the source code for all modules it&#xA;  contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus&#xA;  the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the&#xA;  library.&#xA;&#xA;  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are&#xA;  not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act&#xA;  of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and&#xA;  output from such a program is covered only if its contents&#xA;  constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use&#xA;  of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true&#xA;  depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses&#xA;  the Library does.&#xA;&#xA;  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the&#xA;  Library&apos;s complete source code as you receive it, in any&#xA;  medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately&#xA;  publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and&#xA;  disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer&#xA;  to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and&#xA;  distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.&#xA;&#xA;  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a&#xA;  copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in&#xA;  exchange for a fee.&#xA;&#xA;  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any&#xA;  portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and&#xA;  copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms&#xA;  of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these&#xA;  conditions:&#xA;&#xA;  a) The modified work must itself be a software library.&#xA;&#xA;  b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices&#xA;  stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.&#xA;&#xA;  c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no&#xA;  charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or&#xA;  a table of data to be supplied by an application program that&#xA;  uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the&#xA;  facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to&#xA;  ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such&#xA;  function or table, the facility still operates, and performs&#xA;  whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.&#xA;&#xA;  (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots&#xA;  has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the&#xA;  application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any&#xA;  application-supplied function or table used by this function&#xA;  must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the&#xA;  square root function must still compute square roots.)&#xA;&#xA;  These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If&#xA;  identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the&#xA;  Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and&#xA;  separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms,&#xA;  do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as&#xA;  separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as&#xA;  part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the&#xA;  distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License,&#xA;  whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire&#xA;  whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote&#xA;  it.&#xA;&#xA;  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or&#xA;  contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the&#xA;  intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of&#xA;  derivative or collective works based on the Library.&#xA;&#xA;  In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the&#xA;  Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library)&#xA;  on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring&#xA;  the other work under the scope of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General&#xA;  Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the&#xA;  Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer&#xA;  to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General&#xA;  Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a&#xA;  newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public&#xA;  License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead&#xA;  if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.&#xA;&#xA;  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for&#xA;  that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to&#xA;  all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.&#xA;&#xA;  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of&#xA;  the Library into a program that is not a library.&#xA;&#xA;  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or&#xA;  derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable&#xA;  form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you&#xA;  accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable&#xA;  source code, which must be distributed under the terms of&#xA;  Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software&#xA;  interchange.&#xA;&#xA;  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to&#xA;  copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to&#xA;  copy the source code from the same place satisfies the&#xA;  requirement to distribute the source code, even though third&#xA;  parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the&#xA;  object code.&#xA;&#xA;  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the&#xA;  Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being&#xA;  compiled or linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the&#xA;  Library&quot;. Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative&#xA;  work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of&#xA;  this License.&#xA;&#xA;  However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with&#xA;  the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the&#xA;  Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather&#xA;  than a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;. The executable is&#xA;  therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for&#xA;  distribution of such executables.&#xA;&#xA;  When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from&#xA;  a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for&#xA;  the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the&#xA;  source code is not. Whether this is true is especially&#xA;  significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if&#xA;  the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true&#xA;  is not precisely defined by law.&#xA;&#xA;  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data&#xA;  structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small&#xA;  inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of&#xA;  the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is&#xA;  legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object&#xA;  code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section&#xA;  6.)&#xA;&#xA;  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may&#xA;  distribute the object code for the work under the terms of&#xA;  Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under&#xA;  Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the&#xA;  Library itself.&#xA;&#xA;  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine&#xA;  or link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the&#xA;  Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library,&#xA;  and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided&#xA;  that the terms permit modification of the work for the&#xA;  customer&apos;s own use and reverse engineering for debugging&#xA;  such modifications.&#xA;&#xA;  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that&#xA;  the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are&#xA;  covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License.&#xA;  If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you&#xA;  must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as&#xA;  well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this&#xA;  License. Also, you must do one of these things:&#xA;&#xA;  a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding&#xA;  machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever&#xA;  changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under&#xA;  Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable&#xA;  linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable&#xA;  &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or&#xA;  source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then&#xA;  relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified&#xA;  Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the&#xA;  contents of definitions files in the Library will not&#xA;  necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the&#xA;  modified definitions.)&#xA;&#xA;  b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the&#xA;  Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a&#xA;  copy of the library already present on the user&apos;s computer&#xA;  system, rather than copying library functions into the&#xA;  executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified&#xA;  version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the&#xA;  modified version is interface-compatible with the version that&#xA;  the work was made with.&#xA;&#xA;  c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least&#xA;  three years, to give the same user the materials specified in&#xA;  Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of&#xA;  performing this distribution.&#xA;&#xA;  d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to&#xA;  copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy&#xA;  the above specified materials from the same place.&#xA;&#xA;  e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these&#xA;  materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.&#xA;&#xA;  For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses&#xA;  the Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs&#xA;  needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a&#xA;  special exception, the materials to be distributed need not&#xA;  include anything that is normally distributed (in either source&#xA;  or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and&#xA;  so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs,&#xA;  unless that component itself accompanies the executable.&#xA;&#xA;  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license&#xA;  restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally&#xA;  accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you&#xA;  cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable&#xA;  that you distribute.&#xA;&#xA;  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the&#xA;  Library side-by-side in a single library together with other&#xA;  library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute&#xA;  such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution&#xA;  of the work based on the Library and of the other library&#xA;  facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do&#xA;  these two things:&#xA;&#xA;  a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work&#xA;  based on the Library, uncombined with any other library&#xA;  facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the&#xA;  Sections above.&#xA;&#xA;  b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact&#xA;  that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining&#xA;  where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.&#xA;&#xA;  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or&#xA;  distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this&#xA;  License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link&#xA;  with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically&#xA;  terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who&#xA;  have received copies, or rights, from you under this License&#xA;  will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties&#xA;  remain in full compliance.&#xA;&#xA;  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have&#xA;  not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to&#xA;  modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These&#xA;  actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.&#xA;  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work&#xA;  based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this&#xA;  License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,&#xA;  distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.&#xA;&#xA;  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on&#xA;  the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license&#xA;  from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or&#xA;  modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You&#xA;  may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients&apos;&#xA;  exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible&#xA;  for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.&#xA;&#xA;  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of&#xA;  patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to&#xA;  patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court&#xA;  order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of&#xA;  this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this&#xA;  License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy&#xA;  simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other&#xA;  pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not&#xA;  distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license&#xA;  would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by&#xA;  all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you,&#xA;  then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License&#xA;  would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.&#xA;&#xA;  If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable&#xA;  under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is&#xA;  intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to&#xA;  apply in other circumstances.&#xA;&#xA;  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe&#xA;  any patents or other property right claims or to contest&#xA;  validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose&#xA;  of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution&#xA;  system which is implemented by public license practices. Many&#xA;  people have made generous contributions to the wide range of&#xA;  software distributed through that system in reliance on&#xA;  consistent application of that system; it is up to the&#xA;  author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute&#xA;  software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose&#xA;  that choice.&#xA;&#xA;  This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is&#xA;  believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted&#xA;  in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted&#xA;  interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library&#xA;  under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution&#xA;  limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is&#xA;  permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such&#xA;  case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in&#xA;  the body of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new&#xA;  versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.&#xA;  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present&#xA;  version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or&#xA;  concerns.&#xA;&#xA;  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the&#xA;  Library specifies a version number of this License which applies&#xA;  to it and &quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of&#xA;  following the terms and conditions either of that version or of&#xA;  any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If&#xA;  the Library does not specify a license version number, you may&#xA;  choose any version ever published by the Free Software&#xA;  Foundation.&#xA;&#xA;  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other&#xA;  free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible&#xA;  with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For&#xA;  software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation,&#xA;  write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make&#xA;  exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two&#xA;  goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our&#xA;  free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software&#xA;  generally.&#xA;&#xA;  NO WARRANTY&#xA;&#xA;  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO&#xA;  WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE&#xA;  LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT&#xA;  HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS&#xA;  IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR&#xA;  IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES&#xA;  OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE&#xA;  ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS&#xA;  WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE&#xA;  COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;&#xA;  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO&#xA;  IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY&#xA;  MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE&#xA;  LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,&#xA;  INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR&#xA;  INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS&#xA;  OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY&#xA;  YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH&#xA;  ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN&#xA;  ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;  END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;&#xA;  How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries&#xA;&#xA;  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the&#xA;  greatest possible use to the public, we recommend making it free&#xA;  software that everyone can redistribute and change. You can do&#xA;  so by permitting redistribution under these terms (or,&#xA;  alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public&#xA;  License).&#xA;&#xA;  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the&#xA;  library. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source&#xA;  file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and&#xA;  each file should have at least the &quot;copyright&quot; line&#xA;  and a pointer to where the full notice is found.&#xA;&#xA;  &lt;one line to give the library&apos;s name and a brief idea of&#xA;  what it does.&gt; Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt; &lt;name of&#xA;  author&gt;&#xA;&#xA;  This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or&#xA;  modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;  License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either&#xA;  version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later&#xA;  version.&#xA;&#xA;  This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,&#xA;  but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of&#xA;  MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU&#xA;  Lesser General Public License for more details.&#xA;&#xA;  You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;  License along with this library; if not, write to the Free&#xA;  Software Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston,&#xA;  MA 02111-1307 USA&#xA;&#xA;  Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and&#xA;  paper mail.&#xA;&#xA;  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer)&#xA;  or your school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright&#xA;  disclaimer&quot; for the library, if necessary. Here is a&#xA;  sample; alter the names:&#xA;&#xA;  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the&#xA;  library `Frob&apos; (a library for tweaking knobs) written by&#xA;  James Random Hacker.&#xA;&#xA;  &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1990 Ty Coon, President of&#xA;  Vice&#xA;&#xA;  That&apos;s all there is to it!

          GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;         Version 2.1, February 1999&#xA;&#xA; Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.&#xA;     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA&#xA; Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies&#xA; of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.&#xA;&#xA;[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts&#xA; as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence&#xA; the version number 2.1.]&#xA;&#xA;       Preamble&#xA;&#xA;  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your&#xA;freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public&#xA;Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change&#xA;free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.&#xA;&#xA;  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some&#xA;specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the&#xA;Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You&#xA;can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether&#xA;this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better&#xA;strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.&#xA;&#xA;  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,&#xA;not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that&#xA;you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge&#xA;for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get&#xA;it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of&#xA;it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do&#xA;these things.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid&#xA;distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these&#xA;rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for&#xA;you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis&#xA;or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave&#xA;you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source&#xA;code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide&#xA;complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them&#xA;with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling&#xA;it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.&#xA;&#xA;  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the&#xA;library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal&#xA;permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that&#xA;there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is&#xA;modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know&#xA;that what they have is not the original version, so that the original&#xA;author&apos;s reputation will not be affected by problems that might be&#xA;introduced by others.&#xA;&#xA;  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of&#xA;any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot&#xA;effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a&#xA;restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that&#xA;any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be&#xA;consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.&#xA;&#xA;  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the&#xA;ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser&#xA;General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and&#xA;is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use&#xA;this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those&#xA;libraries into non-free programs.&#xA;&#xA;  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using&#xA;a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a&#xA;combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary&#xA;General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the&#xA;entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General&#xA;Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with&#xA;the library.&#xA;&#xA;  We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because it&#xA;does Less to protect the user&apos;s freedom than the ordinary General&#xA;Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less&#xA;of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages&#xA;are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many&#xA;libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain&#xA;special circumstances.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to&#xA;encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes&#xA;a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be&#xA;allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free&#xA;library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this&#xA;case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free&#xA;software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free&#xA;programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of&#xA;free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in&#xA;non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU&#xA;operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating&#xA;system.&#xA;&#xA;  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the&#xA;users&apos; freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is&#xA;linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run&#xA;that program using a modified version of the Library.&#xA;&#xA;  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a&#xA;&quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;.  The&#xA;former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must&#xA;be combined with the library in order to run.&#xA;&#xA;    GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION&#xA;&#xA;  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other&#xA;program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or&#xA;other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of&#xA;this Lesser General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;).&#xA;Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data&#xA;prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs&#xA;(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work&#xA;which has been distributed under these terms.  A &quot;work based on the&#xA;Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under&#xA;copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a&#xA;portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated&#xA;straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is&#xA;included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for&#xA;making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means&#xA;all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated&#xA;interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation&#xA;and installation of the library.&#xA;&#xA;  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not&#xA;covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of&#xA;running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from&#xA;such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based&#xA;on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for&#xA;writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does&#xA;and what the program that uses the Library does.&#xA;  &#xA;  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library&apos;s&#xA;complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that&#xA;you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an&#xA;appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact&#xA;all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any&#xA;warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the&#xA;Library.&#xA;&#xA;  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,&#xA;and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a&#xA;fee.&#xA;&#xA;  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion&#xA;of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and&#xA;distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1&#xA;above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;&#xA;    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.&#xA;&#xA;    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices&#xA;    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.&#xA;&#xA;    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no&#xA;    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.&#xA;&#xA;    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a&#xA;    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses&#xA;    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility&#xA;    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,&#xA;    in the event an application does not supply such function or&#xA;    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of&#xA;    its purpose remains meaningful.&#xA;&#xA;    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has&#xA;    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the&#xA;    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any&#xA;    application-supplied function or table used by this function must&#xA;    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square&#xA;    root function must still compute square roots.)&#xA;&#xA;These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If&#xA;identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,&#xA;and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in&#xA;themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those&#xA;sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you&#xA;distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based&#xA;on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of&#xA;this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the&#xA;entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote&#xA;it.&#xA;&#xA;Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest&#xA;your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to&#xA;exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or&#xA;collective works based on the Library.&#xA;&#xA;In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library&#xA;with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of&#xA;a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under&#xA;the scope of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public&#xA;License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do&#xA;this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so&#xA;that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,&#xA;instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the&#xA;ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify&#xA;that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in&#xA;these notices.&#xA;&#xA;  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for&#xA;that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all&#xA;subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.&#xA;&#xA;  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of&#xA;the Library into a program that is not a library.&#xA;&#xA;  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or&#xA;derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form&#xA;under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany&#xA;it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which&#xA;must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a&#xA;medium customarily used for software interchange.&#xA;&#xA;  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy&#xA;from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the&#xA;source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to&#xA;distribute the source code, even though third parties are not&#xA;compelled to copy the source along with the object code.&#xA;&#xA;  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the&#xA;Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or&#xA;linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;.  Such a&#xA;work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and&#xA;therefore falls outside the scope of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library&#xA;creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it&#xA;contains portions of the Library), rather than a &quot;work that uses the&#xA;library&quot;.  The executable is therefore covered by this License.&#xA;Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.&#xA;&#xA;  When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from a header file&#xA;that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a&#xA;derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.&#xA;Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be&#xA;linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The&#xA;threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.&#xA;&#xA;  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data&#xA;structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline&#xA;functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object&#xA;file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative&#xA;work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the&#xA;Library will still fall under Section 6.)&#xA;&#xA;  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may&#xA;distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.&#xA;Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,&#xA;whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.&#xA;&#xA;  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or&#xA;link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the Library to produce a&#xA;work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work&#xA;under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit&#xA;modification of the work for the customer&apos;s own use and reverse&#xA;engineering for debugging such modifications.&#xA;&#xA;  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the&#xA;Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by&#xA;this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work&#xA;during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the&#xA;copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference&#xA;directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one&#xA;of these things:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding&#xA;    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever&#xA;    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under&#xA;    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked&#xA;    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that&#xA;    uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that the&#xA;    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified&#xA;    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood&#xA;    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the&#xA;    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application&#xA;    to use the modified definitions.)&#xA;&#xA;    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the&#xA;    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a&#xA;    copy of the library already present on the user&apos;s computer system,&#xA;    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)&#xA;    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if&#xA;    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is&#xA;    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.&#xA;&#xA;    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at&#xA;    least three years, to give the same user the materials&#xA;    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more&#xA;    than the cost of performing this distribution.&#xA;&#xA;    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy&#xA;    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above&#xA;    specified materials from the same place.&#xA;&#xA;    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these&#xA;    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.&#xA;&#xA;  For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses the&#xA;Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs needed for&#xA;reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,&#xA;the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is&#xA;normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major&#xA;components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on&#xA;which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies&#xA;the executable.&#xA;&#xA;  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license&#xA;restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally&#xA;accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot&#xA;use both them and the Library together in an executable that you&#xA;distribute.&#xA;&#xA;  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the&#xA;Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library&#xA;facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined&#xA;library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on&#xA;the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise&#xA;permitted, and provided that you do these two things:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work&#xA;    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library&#xA;    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the&#xA;    Sections above.&#xA;&#xA;    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact&#xA;    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining&#xA;    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.&#xA;&#xA;  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute&#xA;the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any&#xA;attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or&#xA;distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your&#xA;rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,&#xA;or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses&#xA;terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.&#xA;&#xA;  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not&#xA;signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or&#xA;distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are&#xA;prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by&#xA;modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the&#xA;Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and&#xA;all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying&#xA;the Library or works based on it.&#xA;&#xA;  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the&#xA;Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the&#xA;original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library&#xA;subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further&#xA;restrictions on the recipients&apos; exercise of the rights granted herein.&#xA;You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with&#xA;this License.&#xA;&#xA;  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent&#xA;infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),&#xA;conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot&#xA;distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you&#xA;may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent&#xA;license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by&#xA;all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then&#xA;the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to&#xA;refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.&#xA;&#xA;If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any&#xA;particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,&#xA;and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.&#xA;&#xA;It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any&#xA;patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any&#xA;such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the&#xA;integrity of the free software distribution system which is&#xA;implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made&#xA;generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed&#xA;through that system in reliance on consistent application of that&#xA;system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing&#xA;to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot&#xA;impose that choice.&#xA;&#xA;This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to&#xA;be a consequence of the rest of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in&#xA;certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the&#xA;original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add&#xA;an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,&#xA;so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus&#xA;excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if&#xA;written in the body of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new&#xA;versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.&#xA;Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,&#xA;but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.&#xA;&#xA;Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library&#xA;specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and&#xA;&quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and&#xA;conditions either of that version or of any later version published by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a&#xA;license version number, you may choose any version ever published by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation.&#xA;&#xA;  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free&#xA;programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,&#xA;write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is&#xA;copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free&#xA;Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our&#xA;decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status&#xA;of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing&#xA;and reuse of software generally.&#xA;&#xA;       NO WARRANTY&#xA;&#xA;  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO&#xA;WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.&#xA;EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR&#xA;OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY&#xA;KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE&#xA;IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#xA;PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE&#xA;LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME&#xA;THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;&#xA;  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN&#xA;WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY&#xA;AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU&#xA;FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR&#xA;CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE&#xA;LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING&#xA;RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A&#xA;FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF&#xA;SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH&#xA;DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;       END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;&#xA;           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries&#xA;&#xA;  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest&#xA;possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that&#xA;everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting&#xA;redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the&#xA;ordinary General Public License).&#xA;&#xA;  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is&#xA;safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively&#xA;convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the&#xA;&quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.&#xA;&#xA;    &lt;one line to give the library&apos;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;&#xA;    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;&#xA;&#xA;    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or&#xA;    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either&#xA;    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.&#xA;&#xA;    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,&#xA;    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of&#xA;    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU&#xA;    Lesser General Public License for more details.&#xA;&#xA;    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software&#xA;    Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA&#xA;&#xA;Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.&#xA;&#xA;You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your&#xA;school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the library, if&#xA;necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:&#xA;&#xA;  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the&#xA;  library `Frob&apos; (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.&#xA;&#xA;  &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1990&#xA;  Ty Coon, President of Vice&#xA;&#xA;That&apos;s all there is to it!

          GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 2.1, February 1999&#xA;&#xA;  Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 59&#xA;  Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA Everyone is&#xA;  permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license&#xA;  document, but changing it is not allowed.&#xA;&#xA;  [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also&#xA;  counts as the successor of the GNU Library Public License,&#xA;  version 2, hence the version number 2.1.]&#xA;&#xA;  Preamble&#xA;&#xA;  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your&#xA;  freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General&#xA;  Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share&#xA;  and change free software--to make sure the software is free for&#xA;  all its users.&#xA;&#xA;  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some&#xA;  specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of&#xA;  the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use&#xA;  it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully&#xA;  about whether this license or the ordinary General Public&#xA;  License is the better strategy to use in any particular case,&#xA;  based on the explanations below.&#xA;&#xA;  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of&#xA;  use, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make&#xA;  sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free&#xA;  software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you&#xA;  receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can&#xA;  change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs;&#xA;  and that you are informed that you can do these things.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid&#xA;  distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender&#xA;  these rights. These restrictions translate to certain&#xA;  responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library&#xA;  or if you modify it.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether&#xA;  gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights&#xA;  that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or&#xA;  can get the source code. If you link other code with the&#xA;  library, you must provide complete object files to the&#xA;  recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after&#xA;  making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must&#xA;  show them these terms so they know their rights.&#xA;&#xA;  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright&#xA;  the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you&#xA;  legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that&#xA;  there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library&#xA;  is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should&#xA;  know that what they have is not the original version, so that&#xA;  the original author&apos;s reputation will not be affected by&#xA;  problems that might be introduced by others.&#xA;&#xA;  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the&#xA;  existence of any free program. We wish to make sure that a&#xA;  company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program&#xA;  by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder.&#xA;  Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a&#xA;  version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom&#xA;  of use specified in this license.&#xA;&#xA;  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the&#xA;  ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU&#xA;  Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated&#xA;  libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General&#xA;  Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in&#xA;  order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.&#xA;&#xA;  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or&#xA;  using a shared library, the combination of the two is legally&#xA;  speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library.&#xA;  The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such&#xA;  linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of&#xA;  freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax&#xA;  criteria for linking other code with the library.&#xA;&#xA;  We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public&#xA;  License because it does Less to protect the user&apos;s freedom&#xA;  than the ordinary General Public License. It also provides other&#xA;  free software developers Less of an advantage over competing&#xA;  non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the&#xA;  ordinary General Public License for many libraries. However, the&#xA;  Lesser license provides advantages in certain special&#xA;  circumstances.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to&#xA;  encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that&#xA;  it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free&#xA;  programs must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent&#xA;  case is that a free library does the same job as widely used&#xA;  non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by&#xA;  limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the&#xA;  Lesser General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in&#xA;  non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a&#xA;  large body of free software. For example, permission to use the&#xA;  GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to&#xA;  use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the&#xA;  GNU/Linux operating system.&#xA;&#xA;  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of&#xA;  the users&apos; freedom, it does ensure that the user of a&#xA;  program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the&#xA;  wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the&#xA;  Library.&#xA;&#xA;  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;  modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference&#xA;  between a &quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work&#xA;  that uses the library&quot;. The former contains code derived&#xA;  from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the&#xA;  library in order to run.&#xA;&#xA;  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR&#xA;  COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION&#xA;&#xA;  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or&#xA;  other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright&#xA;  holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed&#xA;  under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also&#xA;  called &quot;this License&quot;). Each licensee is addressed as&#xA;  &quot;you&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions&#xA;  and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with&#xA;  application programs (which use some of those functions and&#xA;  data) to form executables.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software&#xA;  library or work which has been distributed under these terms. A&#xA;  &quot;work based on the Library&quot; means either the Library&#xA;  or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a&#xA;  work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim&#xA;  or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into&#xA;  another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without&#xA;  limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of&#xA;  the work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete&#xA;  source code means all the source code for all modules it&#xA;  contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus&#xA;  the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the&#xA;  library.&#xA;&#xA;  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are&#xA;  not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act&#xA;  of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and&#xA;  output from such a program is covered only if its contents&#xA;  constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use&#xA;  of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true&#xA;  depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses&#xA;  the Library does.&#xA;&#xA;  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the&#xA;  Library&apos;s complete source code as you receive it, in any&#xA;  medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately&#xA;  publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and&#xA;  disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer&#xA;  to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and&#xA;  distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.&#xA;&#xA;  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a&#xA;  copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in&#xA;  exchange for a fee.&#xA;&#xA;  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any&#xA;  portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and&#xA;  copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms&#xA;  of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these&#xA;  conditions:&#xA;&#xA;  a) The modified work must itself be a software library.&#xA;&#xA;  b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices&#xA;  stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.&#xA;&#xA;  c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no&#xA;  charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or&#xA;  a table of data to be supplied by an application program that&#xA;  uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the&#xA;  facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to&#xA;  ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such&#xA;  function or table, the facility still operates, and performs&#xA;  whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.&#xA;&#xA;  (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots&#xA;  has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the&#xA;  application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any&#xA;  application-supplied function or table used by this function&#xA;  must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the&#xA;  square root function must still compute square roots.)&#xA;&#xA;  These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If&#xA;  identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the&#xA;  Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and&#xA;  separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms,&#xA;  do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as&#xA;  separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as&#xA;  part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the&#xA;  distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License,&#xA;  whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire&#xA;  whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote&#xA;  it.&#xA;&#xA;  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or&#xA;  contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the&#xA;  intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of&#xA;  derivative or collective works based on the Library.&#xA;&#xA;  In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the&#xA;  Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library)&#xA;  on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring&#xA;  the other work under the scope of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General&#xA;  Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the&#xA;  Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer&#xA;  to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General&#xA;  Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a&#xA;  newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public&#xA;  License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead&#xA;  if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.&#xA;&#xA;  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for&#xA;  that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to&#xA;  all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.&#xA;&#xA;  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of&#xA;  the Library into a program that is not a library.&#xA;&#xA;  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or&#xA;  derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable&#xA;  form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you&#xA;  accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable&#xA;  source code, which must be distributed under the terms of&#xA;  Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software&#xA;  interchange.&#xA;&#xA;  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to&#xA;  copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to&#xA;  copy the source code from the same place satisfies the&#xA;  requirement to distribute the source code, even though third&#xA;  parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the&#xA;  object code.&#xA;&#xA;  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the&#xA;  Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being&#xA;  compiled or linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the&#xA;  Library&quot;. Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative&#xA;  work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of&#xA;  this License.&#xA;&#xA;  However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with&#xA;  the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the&#xA;  Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather&#xA;  than a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;. The executable is&#xA;  therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for&#xA;  distribution of such executables.&#xA;&#xA;  When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from&#xA;  a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for&#xA;  the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the&#xA;  source code is not. Whether this is true is especially&#xA;  significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if&#xA;  the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true&#xA;  is not precisely defined by law.&#xA;&#xA;  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data&#xA;  structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small&#xA;  inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of&#xA;  the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is&#xA;  legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object&#xA;  code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section&#xA;  6.)&#xA;&#xA;  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may&#xA;  distribute the object code for the work under the terms of&#xA;  Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under&#xA;  Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the&#xA;  Library itself.&#xA;&#xA;  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine&#xA;  or link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the&#xA;  Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library,&#xA;  and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided&#xA;  that the terms permit modification of the work for the&#xA;  customer&apos;s own use and reverse engineering for debugging&#xA;  such modifications.&#xA;&#xA;  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that&#xA;  the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are&#xA;  covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License.&#xA;  If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you&#xA;  must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as&#xA;  well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this&#xA;  License. Also, you must do one of these things:&#xA;&#xA;  a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding&#xA;  machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever&#xA;  changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under&#xA;  Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable&#xA;  linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable&#xA;  &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or&#xA;  source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then&#xA;  relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified&#xA;  Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the&#xA;  contents of definitions files in the Library will not&#xA;  necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the&#xA;  modified definitions.)&#xA;&#xA;  b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the&#xA;  Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a&#xA;  copy of the library already present on the user&apos;s computer&#xA;  system, rather than copying library functions into the&#xA;  executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified&#xA;  version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the&#xA;  modified version is interface-compatible with the version that&#xA;  the work was made with.&#xA;&#xA;  c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least&#xA;  three years, to give the same user the materials specified in&#xA;  Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of&#xA;  performing this distribution.&#xA;&#xA;  d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to&#xA;  copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy&#xA;  the above specified materials from the same place.&#xA;&#xA;  e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these&#xA;  materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.&#xA;&#xA;  For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses&#xA;  the Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs&#xA;  needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a&#xA;  special exception, the materials to be distributed need not&#xA;  include anything that is normally distributed (in either source&#xA;  or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and&#xA;  so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs,&#xA;  unless that component itself accompanies the executable.&#xA;&#xA;  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license&#xA;  restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally&#xA;  accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you&#xA;  cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable&#xA;  that you distribute.&#xA;&#xA;  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the&#xA;  Library side-by-side in a single library together with other&#xA;  library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute&#xA;  such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution&#xA;  of the work based on the Library and of the other library&#xA;  facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do&#xA;  these two things:&#xA;&#xA;  a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work&#xA;  based on the Library, uncombined with any other library&#xA;  facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the&#xA;  Sections above.&#xA;&#xA;  b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact&#xA;  that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining&#xA;  where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.&#xA;&#xA;  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or&#xA;  distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this&#xA;  License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link&#xA;  with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically&#xA;  terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who&#xA;  have received copies, or rights, from you under this License&#xA;  will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties&#xA;  remain in full compliance.&#xA;&#xA;  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have&#xA;  not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to&#xA;  modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These&#xA;  actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.&#xA;  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work&#xA;  based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this&#xA;  License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,&#xA;  distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.&#xA;&#xA;  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on&#xA;  the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license&#xA;  from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or&#xA;  modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You&#xA;  may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients&apos;&#xA;  exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible&#xA;  for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.&#xA;&#xA;  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of&#xA;  patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to&#xA;  patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court&#xA;  order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of&#xA;  this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this&#xA;  License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy&#xA;  simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other&#xA;  pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not&#xA;  distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license&#xA;  would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by&#xA;  all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you,&#xA;  then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License&#xA;  would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.&#xA;&#xA;  If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable&#xA;  under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is&#xA;  intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to&#xA;  apply in other circumstances.&#xA;&#xA;  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe&#xA;  any patents or other property right claims or to contest&#xA;  validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose&#xA;  of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution&#xA;  system which is implemented by public license practices. Many&#xA;  people have made generous contributions to the wide range of&#xA;  software distributed through that system in reliance on&#xA;  consistent application of that system; it is up to the&#xA;  author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute&#xA;  software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose&#xA;  that choice.&#xA;&#xA;  This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is&#xA;  believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted&#xA;  in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted&#xA;  interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library&#xA;  under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution&#xA;  limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is&#xA;  permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such&#xA;  case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in&#xA;  the body of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new&#xA;  versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.&#xA;  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present&#xA;  version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or&#xA;  concerns.&#xA;&#xA;  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the&#xA;  Library specifies a version number of this License which applies&#xA;  to it and &quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of&#xA;  following the terms and conditions either of that version or of&#xA;  any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If&#xA;  the Library does not specify a license version number, you may&#xA;  choose any version ever published by the Free Software&#xA;  Foundation.&#xA;&#xA;  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other&#xA;  free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible&#xA;  with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For&#xA;  software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation,&#xA;  write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make&#xA;  exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two&#xA;  goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our&#xA;  free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software&#xA;  generally.&#xA;&#xA;  NO WARRANTY&#xA;&#xA;  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO&#xA;  WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE&#xA;  LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT&#xA;  HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS&#xA;  IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR&#xA;  IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES&#xA;  OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE&#xA;  ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS&#xA;  WITH YOU.

          GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 2.1, February 1999&#xA;&#xA;  Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 59&#xA;  Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA Everyone is&#xA;  permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license&#xA;  document, but changing it is not allowed.&#xA;&#xA;  [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also&#xA;  counts as the successor of the GNU Library Public License,&#xA;  version 2, hence the version number 2.1.]&#xA;&#xA;  Preamble&#xA;&#xA;  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your&#xA;  freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General&#xA;  Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share&#xA;  and change free software--to make sure the software is free for&#xA;  all its users.&#xA;&#xA;  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some&#xA;  specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of&#xA;  the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use&#xA;  it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully&#xA;  about whether this license or the ordinary General Public&#xA;  License is the better strategy to use in any particular case,&#xA;  based on the explanations below.&#xA;&#xA;  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of&#xA;  use, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make&#xA;  sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free&#xA;  software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you&#xA;  receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can&#xA;  change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs;&#xA;  and that you are informed that you can do these things.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid&#xA;  distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender&#xA;  these rights. These restrictions translate to certain&#xA;  responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library&#xA;  or if you modify it.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether&#xA;  gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights&#xA;  that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or&#xA;  can get the source code. If you link other code with the&#xA;  library, you must provide complete object files to the&#xA;  recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after&#xA;  making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must&#xA;  show them these terms so they know their rights.&#xA;&#xA;  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright&#xA;  the library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you&#xA;  legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that&#xA;  there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library&#xA;  is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should&#xA;  know that what they have is not the original version, so that&#xA;  the original author&apos;s reputation will not be affected by&#xA;  problems that might be introduced by others.&#xA;&#xA;  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the&#xA;  existence of any free program. We wish to make sure that a&#xA;  company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program&#xA;  by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder.&#xA;  Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a&#xA;  version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom&#xA;  of use specified in this license.&#xA;&#xA;  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the&#xA;  ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU&#xA;  Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated&#xA;  libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General&#xA;  Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in&#xA;  order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.&#xA;&#xA;  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or&#xA;  using a shared library, the combination of the two is legally&#xA;  speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library.&#xA;  The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such&#xA;  linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of&#xA;  freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax&#xA;  criteria for linking other code with the library.&#xA;&#xA;  We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public&#xA;  License because it does Less to protect the user&apos;s freedom&#xA;  than the ordinary General Public License. It also provides other&#xA;  free software developers Less of an advantage over competing&#xA;  non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the&#xA;  ordinary General Public License for many libraries. However, the&#xA;  Lesser license provides advantages in certain special&#xA;  circumstances.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to&#xA;  encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that&#xA;  it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free&#xA;  programs must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent&#xA;  case is that a free library does the same job as widely used&#xA;  non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by&#xA;  limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the&#xA;  Lesser General Public License.&#xA;&#xA;  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in&#xA;  non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a&#xA;  large body of free software. For example, permission to use the&#xA;  GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to&#xA;  use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the&#xA;  GNU/Linux operating system.&#xA;&#xA;  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of&#xA;  the users&apos; freedom, it does ensure that the user of a&#xA;  program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the&#xA;  wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the&#xA;  Library.&#xA;&#xA;  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;  modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference&#xA;  between a &quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work&#xA;  that uses the library&quot;. The former contains code derived&#xA;  from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the&#xA;  library in order to run.&#xA;&#xA;  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR&#xA;  COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION&#xA;&#xA;  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or&#xA;  other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright&#xA;  holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed&#xA;  under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also&#xA;  called &quot;this License&quot;). Each licensee is addressed as&#xA;  &quot;you&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;  A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions&#xA;  and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with&#xA;  application programs (which use some of those functions and&#xA;  data) to form executables.&#xA;&#xA;  The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software&#xA;  library or work which has been distributed under these terms. A&#xA;  &quot;work based on the Library&quot; means either the Library&#xA;  or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a&#xA;  work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim&#xA;  or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into&#xA;  another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without&#xA;  limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)&#xA;&#xA;  &quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of&#xA;  the work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete&#xA;  source code means all the source code for all modules it&#xA;  contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus&#xA;  the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the&#xA;  library.&#xA;&#xA;  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are&#xA;  not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act&#xA;  of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and&#xA;  output from such a program is covered only if its contents&#xA;  constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use&#xA;  of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true&#xA;  depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses&#xA;  the Library does.&#xA;&#xA;  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the&#xA;  Library&apos;s complete source code as you receive it, in any&#xA;  medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately&#xA;  publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and&#xA;  disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer&#xA;  to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and&#xA;  distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.&#xA;&#xA;  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a&#xA;  copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in&#xA;  exchange for a fee.&#xA;&#xA;  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any&#xA;  portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and&#xA;  copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms&#xA;  of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these&#xA;  conditions:&#xA;&#xA;  a) The modified work must itself be a software library.&#xA;&#xA;  b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices&#xA;  stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.&#xA;&#xA;  c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no&#xA;  charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or&#xA;  a table of data to be supplied by an application program that&#xA;  uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the&#xA;  facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to&#xA;  ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such&#xA;  function or table, the facility still operates, and performs&#xA;  whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.&#xA;&#xA;  (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots&#xA;  has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the&#xA;  application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any&#xA;  application-supplied function or table used by this function&#xA;  must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the&#xA;  square root function must still compute square roots.)&#xA;&#xA;  These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If&#xA;  identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the&#xA;  Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and&#xA;  separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms,&#xA;  do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as&#xA;  separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as&#xA;  part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the&#xA;  distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License,&#xA;  whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire&#xA;  whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote&#xA;  it.&#xA;&#xA;  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or&#xA;  contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the&#xA;  intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of&#xA;  derivative or collective works based on the Library.&#xA;&#xA;  In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the&#xA;  Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library)&#xA;  on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring&#xA;  the other work under the scope of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General&#xA;  Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the&#xA;  Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer&#xA;  to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General&#xA;  Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a&#xA;  newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public&#xA;  License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead&#xA;  if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.&#xA;&#xA;  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for&#xA;  that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to&#xA;  all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.&#xA;&#xA;  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of&#xA;  the Library into a program that is not a library.&#xA;&#xA;  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or&#xA;  derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable&#xA;  form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you&#xA;  accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable&#xA;  source code, which must be distributed under the terms of&#xA;  Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software&#xA;  interchange.&#xA;&#xA;  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to&#xA;  copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to&#xA;  copy the source code from the same place satisfies the&#xA;  requirement to distribute the source code, even though third&#xA;  parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the&#xA;  object code.&#xA;&#xA;  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the&#xA;  Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being&#xA;  compiled or linked with it, is called a &quot;work that uses the&#xA;  Library&quot;. Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative&#xA;  work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of&#xA;  this License.&#xA;&#xA;  However, linking a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with&#xA;  the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the&#xA;  Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather&#xA;  than a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;. The executable is&#xA;  therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for&#xA;  distribution of such executables.&#xA;&#xA;  When a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; uses material from&#xA;  a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for&#xA;  the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the&#xA;  source code is not. Whether this is true is especially&#xA;  significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if&#xA;  the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true&#xA;  is not precisely defined by law.&#xA;&#xA;  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data&#xA;  structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small&#xA;  inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of&#xA;  the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is&#xA;  legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object&#xA;  code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section&#xA;  6.)&#xA;&#xA;  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may&#xA;  distribute the object code for the work under the terms of&#xA;  Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under&#xA;  Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the&#xA;  Library itself.&#xA;&#xA;  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine&#xA;  or link a &quot;work that uses the Library&quot; with the&#xA;  Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library,&#xA;  and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided&#xA;  that the terms permit modification of the work for the&#xA;  customer&apos;s own use and reverse engineering for debugging&#xA;  such modifications.&#xA;&#xA;  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that&#xA;  the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are&#xA;  covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License.&#xA;  If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you&#xA;  must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as&#xA;  well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this&#xA;  License. Also, you must do one of these things:&#xA;&#xA;  a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding&#xA;  machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever&#xA;  changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under&#xA;  Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable&#xA;  linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable&#xA;  &quot;work that uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or&#xA;  source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then&#xA;  relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified&#xA;  Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the&#xA;  contents of definitions files in the Library will not&#xA;  necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the&#xA;  modified definitions.)&#xA;&#xA;  b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the&#xA;  Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a&#xA;  copy of the library already present on the user&apos;s computer&#xA;  system, rather than copying library functions into the&#xA;  executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified&#xA;  version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the&#xA;  modified version is interface-compatible with the version that&#xA;  the work was made with.&#xA;&#xA;  c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least&#xA;  three years, to give the same user the materials specified in&#xA;  Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of&#xA;  performing this distribution.&#xA;&#xA;  d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to&#xA;  copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy&#xA;  the above specified materials from the same place.&#xA;&#xA;  e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these&#xA;  materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.&#xA;&#xA;  For an executable, the required form of the &quot;work that uses&#xA;  the Library&quot; must include any data and utility programs&#xA;  needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a&#xA;  special exception, the materials to be distributed need not&#xA;  include anything that is normally distributed (in either source&#xA;  or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and&#xA;  so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs,&#xA;  unless that component itself accompanies the executable.&#xA;&#xA;  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license&#xA;  restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally&#xA;  accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you&#xA;  cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable&#xA;  that you distribute.&#xA;&#xA;  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the&#xA;  Library side-by-side in a single library together with other&#xA;  library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute&#xA;  such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution&#xA;  of the work based on the Library and of the other library&#xA;  facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do&#xA;  these two things:&#xA;&#xA;  a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work&#xA;  based on the Library, uncombined with any other library&#xA;  facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the&#xA;  Sections above.&#xA;&#xA;  b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact&#xA;  that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining&#xA;  where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.&#xA;&#xA;  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or&#xA;  distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this&#xA;  License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link&#xA;  with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically&#xA;  terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who&#xA;  have received copies, or rights, from you under this License&#xA;  will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties&#xA;  remain in full compliance.&#xA;&#xA;  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have&#xA;  not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to&#xA;  modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These&#xA;  actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.&#xA;  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work&#xA;  based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this&#xA;  License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,&#xA;  distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.&#xA;&#xA;  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on&#xA;  the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license&#xA;  from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or&#xA;  modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You&#xA;  may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients&apos;&#xA;  exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible&#xA;  for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.&#xA;&#xA;  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of&#xA;  patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to&#xA;  patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court&#xA;  order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of&#xA;  this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this&#xA;  License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy&#xA;  simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other&#xA;  pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not&#xA;  distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license&#xA;  would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by&#xA;  all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you,&#xA;  then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License&#xA;  would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.&#xA;&#xA;  If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable&#xA;  under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is&#xA;  intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to&#xA;  apply in other circumstances.&#xA;&#xA;  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe&#xA;  any patents or other property right claims or to contest&#xA;  validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose&#xA;  of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution&#xA;  system which is implemented by public license practices. Many&#xA;  people have made generous contributions to the wide range of&#xA;  software distributed through that system in reliance on&#xA;  consistent application of that system; it is up to the&#xA;  author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute&#xA;  software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose&#xA;  that choice.&#xA;&#xA;  This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is&#xA;  believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted&#xA;  in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted&#xA;  interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library&#xA;  under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution&#xA;  limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is&#xA;  permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such&#xA;  case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in&#xA;  the body of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new&#xA;  versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.&#xA;  Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present&#xA;  version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or&#xA;  concerns.&#xA;&#xA;  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the&#xA;  Library specifies a version number of this License which applies&#xA;  to it and &quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of&#xA;  following the terms and conditions either of that version or of&#xA;  any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If&#xA;  the Library does not specify a license version number, you may&#xA;  choose any version ever published by the Free Software&#xA;  Foundation.&#xA;&#xA;  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other&#xA;  free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible&#xA;  with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For&#xA;  software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation,&#xA;  write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make&#xA;  exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two&#xA;  goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our&#xA;  free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software&#xA;  generally.&#xA;&#xA;  NO WARRANTY&#xA;&#xA;  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO&#xA;  WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE&#xA;  LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT&#xA;  HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS&#xA;  IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR&#xA;  IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES&#xA;  OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE&#xA;  ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS&#xA;  WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE&#xA;  COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;&#xA;  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO&#xA;  IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY&#xA;  MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE&#xA;  LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,&#xA;  INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR&#xA;  INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS&#xA;  OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY&#xA;  YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH&#xA;  ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN&#xA;  ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;  END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;&#xA;  How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries&#xA;&#xA;  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the&#xA;  greatest possible use to the public, we recommend making it free&#xA;  software that everyone can redistribute and change. You can do&#xA;  so by permitting redistribution under these terms (or,&#xA;  alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public&#xA;  License).&#xA;&#xA;  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the&#xA;  library. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source&#xA;  file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and&#xA;  each file should have at least the &quot;copyright&quot; line&#xA;  and a pointer to where the full notice is found.&#xA;&#xA;  &lt;one line to give the library&apos;s name and a brief idea of&#xA;  what it does.&gt; Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt; &lt;name of&#xA;  author&gt;&#xA;&#xA;  This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or&#xA;  modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public&#xA;  License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either&#xA;  version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later&#xA;  version.&#xA;&#xA;  This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,&#xA;  but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of&#xA;  MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Here is a&#xA;  sample; alter the names:&#xA;&#xA;  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the&#xA;  library `Frob&apos; (a library for tweaking knobs) written by&#xA;  James Random Hacker.&#xA;&#xA;  &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1990 Ty Coon, President of&#xA;  Vice&#xA;&#xA;  That&apos;s all there is to it!
